# User Interface Language of Jenkins and SonarQube
Tags: sonar;jenkins

------

The UI language of Jenkins and SonarQube (previously Sonar) is determined by two things: 1. If your Jenkins/SonarQube server has locale plugin; 2. your browser language settings. 

 

# Locale Plugin

 

Install [Jenkins Locale Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Locale+Plugin) or [SonarQube Chinese Pack](http://docs.codehaus.org/display/SONAR/Chinese+Pack). Then your server has multilingual ability.

 

# Browser Language Settings

 

In Chrome, it is [Settings -> Advanced Settings -> Languages -> Languages and spell-checker settings], drag "English" upper than "Chinese".
