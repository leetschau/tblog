# gitg

Very intuitive branch model.
You can select different branch,
which will be displayed as the left-most line in the branch view panel.
Cover the functions of giggle.

# gitk

Come with git.
See all branches: `gitk --all`.
Not intuitive for branching information.

# git gui

Install with `aptitude install git-gui`.

Use gitk's branch-browsing interface.

# SmartGit

[SmartGit](http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/) is free for non-commercial use.
You have to download the installer, extract it and run.

# giggle

Install with `aptitude install giggle`.

You can browse the history of a file.

# git cola

Install with `aptitude install git-cola`.

Like git gui, use gitk's branch-browsing interface, too.

# Summary

gitg is the first choice.
SmartGit is good except its license restriction.
