Synopsis: xargs <command> <command options>

When you run "<command> | xargs <command2> <cmd2-options>",
and the result of (only) running <command> is:

    <cmd1-result-line1>
    <cmd1-result-line2>
    ...

actually you are running:

    <command2> <cmd2-options> <cmd1-result-line1>
    <command2> <cmd2-options> <cmd1-result-line2>
    ...

If you want add <cmd1-result> before <cmd2-options>, you have to use -I options.
Usually we use "%" as a placeholder.
For example, `echo '1\n2\n3' |xargs -n 1 echo ok` produces:

    ok 1
    ok 2
    ok 3

while `echo '1\n2\n3' |xargs -n 1 -I % echo % ok` produces:

    1 ok
    2 ok
    3 ok

Here "-n 1" means the maximum number of arguments is 1 in every command line. 

So `echo '1\n2\n3'|xargs -n 2 echo ok` produces:

    ok 1 2 
    ok 3 

The following command gives the total lines of java code under current directory
(and subdirectories):

    find . -name '*.java'|xargs wc -l

while

    find . -name '*.java'|wc -l

produces how many java files under current directory (and subdirectories).

Note: the quotes of "*.java" is necessary.
