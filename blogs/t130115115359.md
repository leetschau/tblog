Tags: plugin;Vim

------

[NERDTree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree) is the best file explorer for vim so far.

# NERDTree configuration in .vimrc

    " NerdTree
    " define open/close shortcut
    map <C-n> :NERDTreeToggle<CR>
    " open a NERDTree automatically when vim starts up if no files were specified
    autocmd StdinReadPre * let s:std_in=1
    autocmd VimEnter * if argc() == 0 && !exists("s:std_in") | NERDTree | endif
    " close NERDTree when all files closed:
    autocmd bufenter * if (winnr("$") == 1 && exists("b:NERDTreeType") && b:NERDTreeType == "primary") | q | endif
