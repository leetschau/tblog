# Debug Scripts in Jupyter Notebook
Tags: debug; ipdb; jupyter; notebook

------

To debug codes in a jupyter notebook:

1. Add `from IPython.core.debugger import set_trace` into the script;

1. Add `set_trace()` as the breakpoint;

1. Run this cell.

Note:

When the breakpoint is in the body of a function,
running the cell will not invoke ipdb,
but call the function will invoke ipdb.

After the debugging is done, remove `set_trace()`.
And rerun the script with menu item *Kernel > Restart & Run All*.
