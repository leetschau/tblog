Information to be transfered between Linux and Windows hosts
are mostly texts and files.

For uploading/downloading files, first ssh to the Linux server
via MobaXterm' SSH client, then use MobaXterm's sftp function.

For transfering texts between the hosts, start a tmux session on Linux host.
SSH to the Linux host via MobaXterm, and attach tmux session.
