Follow tutorial on [selenium python client](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/selenium) official site. This webdriver is much better than remote control (selenium 1.x) for it need no server. A short python function can do all the automation jobs. And it has assertion functions. Cool.

 

I am trying to automate Fetion auto-login with webdriver. But the new firefox browser has not default Fetion username inputed before hand. So I will finish this script some day.
