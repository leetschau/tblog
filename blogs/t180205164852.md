Tags: python; super class; hierarchy

------

You can call the method of the parent class by its name directly:
```
$ cat callpm.py
class A():
    def bar(self, string):
        print("Hi, I'm bar, inherited from A" + string)

class B(A):
    def baz(self):
        self.bar(" - called by baz in B")

B().baz()

$  python --version
Python 3.6.3 :: Anaconda, Inc.

$ python callpm.py
Hi, I'm bar, inherited from A - called by baz in B
```
