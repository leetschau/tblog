# Using docker on Windows
Tags: docker; windows

------

Firstly, you must use system level shadowsocks to download and install
the following apps.

Install virtualbox and docker with
```
choco install virtualbox
choco install docker-toolbox
```

When installation complete, run *Docker Quickstart Terminal* from the start menu.
If it stucks when downloading the file *boot2docker.iso* from
[github repo](https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker/releases/download/v17.06.2-ce/boot2docker.iso),
download this file manually and put it into folder
*c:\Users\lee_c\.docker\machine\cache\*.
Then run *Docker Quickstart Terminal* again.

Note:

A new application *Docker for Windows* is recommended by docker authorities.
However it only runs with Hyper-V, which is unavailable on Windows Home edition.
