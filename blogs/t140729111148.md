# A Remote Execution Tool Without Installation
Tags: fabric; remote

------

The following is a question I want to post to StackOverflow.com:

I am developing a environment detection tools, which gather information of many hosts and compare them with some standards.

However it's not allowed to install anything on these hosts. So my plan is running some shell scripts remotely on these hosts via ssh, such as "free", "df", "java -version", etc.

There are many tools for deployment automation, such as Salt, Puppet, CFEngine, etc. But they all need to install something all the client. I found Fabric meet my needs, but the function is a little limited. So my question is:

Are there any remote execution tools without installation on client, like Fabric?
