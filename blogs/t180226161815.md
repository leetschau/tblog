# `diff` Function in R base Package
Tags: difference; function

------

For the function `diff` in *base* package of R,
the parameter *lag* means the difference between which 2 element,
the default value is 1.
If `lag=2`, the difference will be calculated between the 3rd and 1st
(`5-1` below), the 4th and the 2nd (`8-3`), etc.

The parameter *differences* is how many time the differences is calculated.
The default value is 1.
If `differences=2`, there will be one more difference calculation on
the first difference result (`2 2 3 4 75` below):
```
> inputs <- c(1,3,5,8,12,87)
> diff(inputs)
[1]  2  2  3  4 75
> diff(inputs, lag = 2)
[1]  4  5  7 79
> diff(inputs, differences = 2)
[1]  0  1  1 71
```
