# Build Gradle Project in Netbeans
Tags: gradle; netbeans

------

* Rename project: edit project name in settings.gradle, then right click project, choose "Reload Project";

* Modify dependencies: edit build.gradle, then right click project, choose [Tasks -> buildDependents];

The jVi plugin is not support Netbeans 8, so its editing is not very convenient like in Eclipse.
