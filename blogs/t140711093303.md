# Wallpaper Changer for Linux Mint
Tags: wallpaper; linux

------

Today I try to use [Wallch](http://sourceforge.net/projects/wall-changer/)
as alternative for [Variety](http://peterlevi.com/variety/),
but it's hard to install and config. So I switch back to Variety.

In Preferences of Variety -> Effects -> Clock,
you can add a desktop clock using Variety. So conky is no longer needed.

The default position of this clock is "SouthEast",
you can modify it in ~/.config/variety/variety.conf.
If you modify "gravity" paramater in "clock_filter" to "NorthEast",
the clock will be placed in higher right corner.
See full description of customization of this clock in
[Configuring the Clock](http:/peterlevi.com/variety/2012/11/configuring-the-clock/).

On Ubuntu 14.04 Unity desktop, I choose
"Dejavu Sans Mono  70" for clock font,
and "汉仪楷体 24" or "" for date font.
