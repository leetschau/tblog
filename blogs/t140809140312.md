# Serial Device Debug on Linux

The device name is "Prolific Technology, Inc. PL2303 Serial Port", you can use `lsusb` to get its name. Then install gtkterm for communicating with it.

    $ sudo apt-get install gtkterm

Now use syslog to get the device name of pl2303.

    $ tail -f /var/log/syslog
    ...
    ... usb 3-2: pl2303 converter now attached to ttyUSB0
    ...

So its device name is /dev/ttyUSB0. Now you can connect it with gtkterm:

    $ sudo gtkterm -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -s 57600

View -> Send hexadecimal data: 41 54 2B 53 43 41 4E

# minicom

    # apt-get install minicom

But I don't know how to send command via this application.
