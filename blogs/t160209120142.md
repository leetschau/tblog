# Install Go

For Linux, download go1.5.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz from [Go homepage](https://golang.org/),
extract it to folder "/usr/local/go". Add the following lines into ~/.zshenv:

    GOROOT=/usr/local/go
    PATH=$PATH:$GOROOT/bin

For Windows, download go1.8.3.windows-amd64.zip and extract to folder
*c:\apps\*. Create a new folder *packages* under *c:\apps\go1.8.3\*.
Add environment variable *GOROOT=c:\apps\go1.8.3* and *GOPATH=c:\apps\go1.8.3\packages*.
You can use *Rapidee* to modify these env variables.

Run `go env` to verify the installation.

# Install packages

Golang repo is blocked by GFW, such as 'https://go.googlesource.com/text/...',
'golang.org/x/...', etc. And `go get` can only use http proxy.
So we have to install [cow](https://github.com/cyfdecyf/cow) as the http proxy.
First download a release (for me it's cow-win64-0.9.8.zip) and extract to C:\apps.
Add the following lines to its rc.txt:

    listen = http://127.0.0.1:7777
    proxy = socks5://127.0.0.1:1080

Here we use a shadowsocks client as the parent proxy,
while cow can use remote ss server directly.

Now run commands below to install a go packages
(no need to modify git proxy configuration):

    set HTTP_PROXY=http://localhost:7777
    set HTTPS_PROXY=http://localhost:7777
    go get -u github.com/monochromegane/the_platinum_searcher/

Note:
Using socks5 proxy directly with `netsh winhttp set` according to 
[Setting a proxy for Windows using the command-line](http://andykdocs.de/development/Windows/Proxy+Configuration+via+Command+Line)
not works.
