# Manage Nodejs App with Forever
Tags: forever; nodejs

------

[forever](https://github.com/foreverjs/forever) is

> A simple CLI tool for ensuring that a given script runs continuously.

For now it only supports nodejs scripts.

It provides functions like `nohup` in shell, but much more.

To start your script, run `forever start -w app.js` instead of `node app.js`.
The "-w" option will watch the file changes.

So update website is simply run `git pull ...` on your production host,
forever will find the changes in your sources and restart server
(like Meteor app in develop mode).

List all running forever managed scripts with `forever list`.

Find out their logs location with `forever logs`.
Then you can use `tail -f` to watch the log of a script in real time.

Print the log of a script with `forever logs <script-index>`,
for example:`forever logs 0`.
You get the index from the output of `forever logs`.
