# Install

    yum install -y java-1.7.0-openjdk-devel
    curl -s get.gvmtool.net|bash
    source "/root/.gvm/bin/gvm-init.sh"
    gvm i groovy 2.2.1

# Usage

    groovysh
    groovy hw.groovy

All files and installed components are in folder ~/.gvm. So simply remove this folder for uninstallation of gvm.

gvm is portable, so if you install gvm as root, just copy .gvm folder to $HOME, chown, then `gvm c` to show the current groovy version. If it's not what you want, `gvm use groovy 2.2.1` to update it.

Install gvm to another host, first copy .gvm folder, then add "source ~/.gvm/bin/gvm-init.sh" into .bashrc(or .zshrc), then check and setup in new host as above.
