# Move Some Commit from One Repo to Another
Tags: git; patch; format-patch; am

------

We need move all commit between origin/develop to develop in an old repo
to a new repo.

Export all commits in old repo:

    cd /path/to/old-repo
    git format-patch origin/develop..develop

Now you have many .patch files in old repo.
Each patch file represents a commit between origin/develop and develop.

Apply these patches in new repo:

    cd /path/to/new-repo
    git checkout develop
    git am /path/to/old-repo/*.patch
