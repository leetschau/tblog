# Install SDKMan on Windows Git Bash
Tags: sdkman; windows; git; bash

------

SDKMan need `zip`, which is not included by Windows Git Bash by default.
To resolve this, go to https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuwin32/files/
and find *zip* in the list.
Download *zip-3.0-bin.zip* and extract *zip.exe* in the *bin* folder.
Copy it to *c:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\*.
And run SDKMan install script again.
