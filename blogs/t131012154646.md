# Universal Feature

* Comment out codes: select code in visual mode, then M-;
  (Alt + semicolon); this is universal for multiple languages supported by Emacs.
  C, Python, Clojure are verified.

* Use C-j instead of Enter to put cursor at the proper position (indention)
  of the next line;

* Modify C indent size to 4 space: add following code into ~/.emacs:

        (defun my-c-mode-common-hook () 
          (setq c-basic-offset 4) 
          (setq c-indent-level 4) 
          (setq tab-width 4)) 
        (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook 'my-c-mode-common-hook) 

* Format codes with right indents on region: C-M-\;

# C Support

* List all key-bindings: F1 b;

* Open buffer in another window: C-x 4 b;

* Write a makefile, compile: M-x compile; run: M-! make run;
  After modification of source code, you just need [M-x<CR>M-! M-p]
  to do compile-run procedure, because M-p is the last command in shell mode.

Here is the demo C source file:

    #include <stdio.h> 
    int main () { 
      printf("hello world\n"); 
      return 0; 
    } 

"return 0:" is necessary, or the return value will be 12,
which will be seen as a exception by the shell.
