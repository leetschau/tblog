(Optional) Install node.js and jshint (with `npm install -g jshint`).
Now you can check syntax with `jshint myfile.js`.

Then install lint plugin [scrooloose/syntastic](https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic) for vim:

1. add `Plugin 'scrooloose/syntastic'` into ~/.vimrc;

1. Run `vim +PluginInstall`, there are totally 6.0MB for its repo,
   so you have to wait quite a while;

Now open a js file, and do some editing.
When file saved, syntastic will mark the lines with errors.

To verify which checker is enabled when editing, run `:SyntasticInfo`in vim.

Check "2.1. Requirements" in syntastic page above for details.

## google/closure-linter

To install [google/closure-linter](https://github.com/google/closure-linter)
as the checker:

    git clone https://github.com/google/closure-linter.git
    cd closure-linter
    sudo python ./setup.py install
    cd ..
    sudo rm -rf closure-linter

Now you can use `gjslint myfile.js` as the checker in terminal.
To make syntastic use gjslint,
add `let g:syntastic_javascript_checkers = ['gjslint']` into ~/.vimrc.

See [Equipping Vim for JavaScript](http://oli.me.uk/2013/06/29/equipping-vim-for-javascript/).

The plugin [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe#ubuntu-linux-x64-super-quick-installation) is very big 
(about 200MB for now).
You have to wait quite a while when install this plugin using Vundle.

When install plugin with Vundle, you have to save .vimrc and **quit**,
then run `PluginInstall` or `PluginClean` in a new vim window.

Note: To remove a plugin managed by Vundle in vim, remove declaration in .vimrc, then run `PluginClean` in vim.
