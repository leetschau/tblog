# Redo

[Redo](http://redobackup.org/)

Most user-friendly of all. The only one supporting mouse.
I backuped system and swap partition on a ftp server (hadoop:hadoop@10.21.3.31).
It provided a tiny OS including terminal, browser, editor, etc.
But it can't backup to your booting USB stick.
So if you want backup to a local disk, you have to backup to another partition or another USB stick.

Restore operation is concise as well.
Select the ftp server when prompting for input "Source Drive", then specify the location of the backup file on the ftp server.

# PING

[PING](http://ping.windowsdream.com/)

Worked ok. Not very user-friendly.
You can backup to your booting USB stick. Didn't test server backup. 

Restore not tested.

# Clonezilla

[Clonezilla](http://clonezilla.org/)

Backup failed for not enough destination disk space. It request bigger free space on destination than source disk.

# G4L

[G4L](http://sourceforge.net/projects/g4l/)

Very slow and can't save space when there are large unused space on source OS disk.
