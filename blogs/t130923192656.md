------

[conque](http://code.google.com/p/conque/) is a vim plugin
which allows you to run shell in a vim buffer.

To install, download conque_2.3.tar.gz and extract it into ~/.vim/bundle
(yes you have to use pathogen to manage your vim plugins).
Start vim, input ":Con<tab>", it will be extract to ":ConqueTerm ",
then input the command you want to run, like bash, clojure, python, etc.

Other commands include ConqueTermSplit, ConqueTermTab, ConqueVSplit.

The workflow is:

1. Start vi and ":ConqueTerm clojure";

1. Input something;

1. Back to normal mode and use ":w mylog" to save your script.

Note: you have to add file name after :w every time saving the script
for the "buftype" attribute is "nofile".
