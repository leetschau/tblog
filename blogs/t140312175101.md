# Convert a Private Project on bitbucket.com to a github Public Project
Tags: git; bitbucket; github

------

1. Create a public repo on github, you can add README or License files on the master branch, suppose the url is:

    https://github.com/leetschau/don4.git

1. Get the private repo:

    $ git clone https://leechau@bitbucket.org/leechau/donno.git
    $ cd donno
    $ git branch -v -a   (list all remote branches for checkout)
    $ git checkout -b develop origin/develop   (copy remote branch to local repo and update working directory)

1. Publish to github, you have 2 choices:

    i. Publish selected branches:

        $ git remote add don4 https://github.com/leetschau/don4.git
        $ git push -u don4 master
        $ git push -u don4 develop

      or you can push your "master" branch to remote as "init" branch for avoid confliction with master branch created on github:

        $ git push don4 master:init

    i. Publish all branches:

        $ git push --mirror https://github.com/leetschau/don4.git

       In this case you can't create README or License files when creating github project, to avoid conflict on master branch.
