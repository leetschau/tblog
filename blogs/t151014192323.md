# Tab and Session Management in vim
Tags: vim; tab; session; plugin

------

Session management is provided by [tpope/vim-obsession](https://github.com/tpope/vim-obsession).
Tab rename function is provided by [gcmt/taboo.vim](https://github.com/gcmt/taboo.vim).

In ~/.vimrc:

    " Customize tabline
    hi TabLineFill term=bold cterm=bold ctermbg=0
    hi TabLine ctermfg=Yellow

    " Taboo
    set sessionoptions+=tabpages,globals
    cabbrev tr TabooRename

    " tab switching shortcuts
    noremap <leader>1 1gt
    noremap <leader>2 2gt
    noremap <leader>3 3gt
    noremap <leader>4 4gt
    noremap <leader>5 5gt
    noremap <leader>6 6gt
    noremap <leader>7 7gt
    noremap <leader>8 8gt
    noremap <leader>9 9gt
    noremap <leader>0 :tablast<cr>

    " Add these into Vundle section
    Plugin 'gcmt/taboo.vim'
    Plugin 'tpope/vim-obsession'

Now open file in a new tab with: `Ctrl-P`, select a file and `Ctrl-O, t`.
Open file in a virtical split window with: `Ctrl-P`, select a file and `Ctrl-O, v`.
Rename tab with: `:tr<Space>new name<Enter>`.
Jump to the 3rd window with `,3`.


Note:

I also tried [xolox/vim-session](https://github.com/xolox/vim-session),
but it can't persist tab name created by Taboo.

For tab easy switch, I've tried `noremap <unique> <C-1> 1gt` based on
[Switching to a particular tab in VIM](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2005214/switching-to-a-particular-tab-in-vim),
where changes M-Num to C-Num, because M-Num is assigned to tmux window switch.
However C-Num can't work,
see [.vimrc mapping for control key not working](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15849537/vimrc-mapping-for-control-key-not-working)
for explanations.
So I adopted `noremap <leader>1 1gt` style based on
[In vim, how can I quickly switch between tabs?](http://superuser.com/questions/410982/in-vim-how-can-i-quickly-switch-between-tabs).

Mapping long Ex commands with `cabbrev` is a very useful for convenient.
Use <Space> or <Enter> instead of <Tab> to enable abbreviation in `cabbrev`.
See `:h :ca`, [Can I (re-) map commands in vim?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/117150/can-i-re-map-commands-in-vim)
and [Aliasing a command in vim](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3878692/aliasing-a-command-in-vim)
for details.

With `cabbrev tr TabooRename`, you can use `:tr<Space>1:tests` to rename current tab into "1:tests".
Here you have to add tab index manually to make `<leader><number>` style switching more convenient.

To make tabline more readable,
I customized the color of it.
See [How do you change the background color of the empty tab space in vim?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4726882/how-do-you-change-the-background-color-of-the-empty-tab-space-in-vim)
and [Customising the colours of vim's tab bar](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7238113/customising-the-colours-of-vims-tab-bar)
for details.
