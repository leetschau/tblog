# Start GUI Application on Another Screen
Tags: Linux; Dispaly; GUI

------

1. On host A, start up a desktop environment like gnome or window manager like i3,
   start a terminal, run `echo $DISPLAY`,
   then you get the display number of this screen, like ":0".

1. Open a terminal on host B and ssh to the previous one, run following command:

    $ export DISPLAY=:0
    $ gvim

   Then you can see the gvim open in the screen of the host A.

1. In most cases the remote display is ":10". So on host A, if you set DISPLAY as ":10",
   you will display a GUI window on the screen of host B.

Running the codes below on host A, you can find the display number of hosts ssh to it:

    netstat -lnt | awk '
      sub(/.*:/,"",$4) && $4 >= 6000 && $4 < 6100 {
        print ($1 == "tcp6" ? "ip6-localhost:" : "localhost:") ($4 - 6000)
      }'

For example:

> localhost:10
> ip6-localhost:10

means the remote display is ":10".
