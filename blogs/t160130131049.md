# Add GUI App into "Run Application" List on Ubuntu
Tags: unity; alt-f2; gui

------

There are many GUI apps which started with a shell script,
like [MongoChef](http://3t.io/mongochef/),
or [SmartGit](http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/).

The most convenient way to run them in Ubuntu Unity is from
"Run Application" dialog (shortcut: Alt-F2).

Add them into the list with
`sudo ln -s /home/leo/apps/smartgit/bin/smartgit.sh smartgit`.

Start them with [Alt-F2, smartgit].

Note the link name shouldn't have extension, like ".sh".
