# List commits where the patterns changes

`git log -p --all -G 'pattern'`: search a string in git history.

`-G` search for all editing activity with "pattern",
while `-S` only search for creation and removal of "pattern",
the results of `-S` is the subset of results of `-G`.

When the "pattern" is in the current commit,
there will be only 1 result of `-S`,
where the pattern is added into the texts.

When the "pattern" is removed in current commit,
there will be 2 results of -S:
the first (which is newer) is where the pattern is removed,
the second is where the pattern is added.

`-p` denotes `--patch`, which will print the editing details.
If you only want to know the commit name which deal with the "pattern",
omit this option.

`--all` search in all branches.

# List all the commits where pattern exists

`git rev-list --all | xargs git grep moveImage`

The oldest commit(last line of the output) in `git log ...` is the same
with the oldest commit in `git rev-list...`.
The newest commit in `git log ...` is the child of the newest commit
in `git rev-list ...`.
