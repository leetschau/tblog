# Create Virtual Network with Virtualbox
Tags: lan;VirtualBox

------

1. Create a virtual machine "ubs1" with ubuntu server 12.04, set its network as Host-only;

1. Start this vm, configure the network manually: IP Address: 192.168.56.11, netmask, gateway and name server address use default value; Set hostname hubs1, domain name as "chadhome", set username "ubsu1"; install OpenSSH server;

1. Create the second vm named "ubs2" with the same settings with above, IP Address is 192.168.56.22, hostname is hubs2, username is ubsu2;

Now you can ssh between host and these 2 guests.
