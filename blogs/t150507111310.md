# Calculate String Length Containing Chinese Characters

I want to remove all lines with only 1 Chinese character.
The origin file is very large,
so I have to filter out all lines with 1 character.
And remove them together.

Sort all lines in the file by their length is a easy way to achieve this.
The content of file origin.txt is:

> 一十一
> 一十二
> 一十三
> 一十四
> 一十五
> 一十六
> 一十七
> 一十八
> 一十九
> 二十

# Shell

    awk '{print length, $0}' origin.txt | sort -n | cut -d " " -f2- | uniq > target.txt

# Python


# Node
