# Window Border Disappeared on Xfce
Tags: Xfce

------

From last week all the window on Mint 14 Xfce has no title bar. There is no background image. No icons on task bar. Some shortcuts are invalid, including Alt+Drag(move window), Alt+F9(minimize), Alt+F4(close window), etc.

Solution:

In terminal: 

    xfdesktop &

taking back the background image;

    xfwm4 &

taking back window border.

bingo.
