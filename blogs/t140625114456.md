# Run GUI Application on Remote Host

Install: `apt-get install xpra`;

I want to run Thunderbird on host 10.32.1.81:

    ssh chad@10.32.1.81 xpra start :100 --start-child=thunderbird
    xpra attach ssh:10.32.1.81:100

Now Thunderbird window appears. You can use "Attach" to add attachment from the
disk of remote server, which means all GUIs from the "root" GUI
can be accessed remotely.

When it's done, press "Ctrl-c" in the terminal window to close Thunderbird
window. Do not click "close" button, it will kill the Thunderbird window in
DISPLAY 100, and you can't visit it any more.

If you want visit this window later:

    ssh chad@10.32.1.81 xpra list    // so you get the $DISPLAY number 100
    xpra attach ssh:10.32.1.81:100   // run this command in AppFinder (Alt-F2) instead of terminal
    xpra detach ssh:81:100           // run this command in AppFinder (Alt-F2) instead of terminal

If you want clear all:

    ssh chad@10.32.1.81 xpra stop :100        // run this command on remote server

If you want to attach to a xpra server on localhost, run `xpra attach :100`;

# Use ssh alias

Add 81 as alias of "chad@10.32.1.81" in ~/.ssh/config.
Then you can use xpra in the following way:

    ssh 81 xpra start :111 --start-child=gedit
    xpra attach ssh:81:111
    ssh 81 xpra list
    ssh 81 xpra stop :111
