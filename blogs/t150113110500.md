# Download Blocked Resource with RTorrent
Tags: rtorrent

------

Today I need download a file via bt seed on [kickass](http://kickass.so/).
However here BitTorrent protocol is blocked.
So I install [rtorrent](https://github.com/rakshasa/rtorrent) on the Linode virtual host via `sudo yum install rtorrent`.
Start it with `rtorrent`, press Backspace, and paste torrent file url in the text box.
The file is downloaded to current folder.

Finally download this file to my computer with `scp myVirtualHost:~/theFile.zip .`.
