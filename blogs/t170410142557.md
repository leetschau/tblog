# Define File Association for Rifle

I want to use apps of WPS to open Word, Excel and PowerPoint files
in a new process (defined by the flag 'f'):
```
cat ~/.config/ranger/rifle.conf
ext docx?, has wps, flag f = wps -- "$@"
ext pdf, has evince, flag f = evince -- "$@"
ext xlsx?, has et, flag f = et -- "$@"
ext pptx?, has wpp, flag f = wpp -- "$@"
ext mp4, has totem, flag f = totem -- "$@"
ext jpg, has eog, flag f = eog -- "$@"
```

Now use `rifle mydoc.docx` in shell, or <Enter> in ranger,
to open docx, doc files without blocking ranger itself.
