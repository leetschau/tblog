# Jump between Tabs in Firefox with Keyboard Shortcuts
Tags: firefox; shortcuts

------

* **Go to specific tab with text** by extension "Tabhunter"

    Setup the invoking key in its preference page. I use F1 as the key.
    Every time F1 is pressed, input some text to activate the corresponding tab.
    Current version (2015/03/27) is 1.0.5.

* **Jump betwwen tabs** with *ctrl+tab*

    In a new tab, type *about:config* in the address bar and press Enter. Click the button promising to be careful.
    Set **browser.ctrlTab.previews** to *true*;
    Now use *ctrl+tab* to jump between two tabs;

    Or use extension "Ctrl-Tab" to achieve the same functionality.

* **Jump between tab groups** with *ctrl+`*

    Create and manage tab groups with *ctrl+shift+e* (see [Use Tab Groups to organize a lot of tabs](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/tab-groups-organize-tabs#w_how-do-i-organize-my-tab-groups) for details).
    And use *ctrl+`* to jump between two tab groups.
