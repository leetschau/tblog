# Xen on LinuxMint
Tags: xen; linuxmint

------

This morning I tried to install Debian 7.6 64bit on the DELL PC, but it failed due to some hardware problems.
Then I installed LinuxMint 17 Xfce 64bit on this machine, and partition disk following [Xen Project Beginners Guide](http://wiki.xenproject.org/wiki/Xen_Project_Beginners_Guide):

> chad@chadpc ~ $ df -h
> Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
> /dev/sda1       276M   45M  218M  17% /boot
> /dev/sda2        15G  4.1G  9.8G  30% /
> ...

where /dev/sda1 is formated as ext2, and /dev/sda2 is formated as ext3, and leave /dev/sda4 unused.

After reboot and login LinuxMint,
modify apt mirror list according to [Official Archive Mirrors for Ubuntu](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archivemirrors),
adding the following lines into /etc/apt/sources.list:

    deb http://mirrors.zju.edu.cn/ubuntu/ trusty main
    deb-src http://mirrors.zju.edu.cn/ubuntu/ trusty main
    deb http://ubuntu.cnssuestc.org/ubuntu/ trusty main
    deb-src http://ubuntu.cnssuestc.org/ubuntu/ trusty main

Then run commands as root:

    apt-get update
    apt-get install openssh-server
    apt-get install lvm2
    pvcreate /dev/sda4
    vgcreate vg0 /dev/sda4
    apt-get install bridge-utils

    brctl addbr xenbr0
    brctl addif xenbr0 eth0
    dhclient xenbr0

    aptitude -P install xen-system  # not xen-linux-system
    dpkg-divert --divert /etc/grub.d/08_linux_xen --rename /etc/grub.d/20_linux_xen
    update-grub
    reboot
    # you can find now "Ubuntu GNU/Linux, with Xen hypervisor" is the default startup item in grub boot menu

# Build DomU

    apt-get install xen-tools

## Using xen-create-image

    xen-create-image --hostname=ch1 --memory=1024gb --vcpus=2 --lvm=vg0 --dhcp --pygrub --dist=wheezy

## Using xl

Follow [Debian Guest Installation Using Debian Installer](http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/Debian_Guest_Installation_Using_Debian_Installer).

Here we download 2 net-install disk (which is very small) and install the guest system via Internet.
So the host machine need to connected with Internet, or can connect to another machine which can access Internet,
and defining a proxy when installing.

Select a mirror [ftp.cn.debian.org/debian/](http://ftp.cn.debian.org/debian/) in [Debian worldwide mirror sites](http://www.debian.org/mirror/list).
And download vmlinuz and initrd.gz (from http://ftp.cn.debian.org/debian/dists/stable/main/installer-amd64/current/images/netboot/xen/)
to local folder /home/chad/warez/xen-images-debian.

Create a config file /root/deb.cfg:

    name = "debian-installer"
    memory = 1024
    disk = ['phy:/dev/vg0/debian-installer,xvda,w']
    vif = [' ']

    kernel = "/home/chad/warez/xen-images-debian/vmlinuz"
    ramdisk = "/home/chad/warez/xen-images-debian/initrd.gz"
    extra = "debian-installer/exit/always_halt=true -- console=hvc0"

Then run following commands as root:

    lvcreate -L 4G -n debian-installer /dev/vg0
    xl create -c /root/deb.cfg

Once installation has completed the guest will shutdown and exit.
Remove the kernel, initrd and extra lines from the guest configuration, here remove the last 3 lines in deb.conf
and replace them with simply:

    bootloader = "pygrub"

Now the deb.conf became:

    name = "debian-installer"
    memory = 1024
    disk = ['phy:/dev/vg0/debian-installer,xvda,w']
    vif = [' ']
    bootloader = "pygrub"

Startup the guest system with `xl create -c deb.cfg`.
List all running vms with `xl list` in dom0.
Connect this vm with `xl console debian-installer`.
List all available subcommands of xl with `xl help`.
Shutdown this vm with `xl shutdown debian-installer`

# Post installation

The "brctl" and "dhclient" commands above only build the network interface during system session.
After system reboot, the bridge interface disappears, thus startup vm will failed.
So we need define the bridge in /etc/network/interfaces, add the following lines into this file:

    auto eth0
    iface eth0 inet dhcp

    auto xenbr0
    iface xenbr0 inet dhcp
        bridge_ports eth0

If after reboot, the eth0 can't get IP address, use `ifdown eth0` and `ifup eth0` to refresh eth0.

Update 2014.10.31: these settings cause network connection failed. After removing "auto xenbr0..." section, everything goes fine.
So use `brctl` and `dhclient` to setup bridge after system startup.

Notes:

1. Use `lsblk -f` to see the volume group and logical volumes.

1. pvcreate means "create physical volume", vgcreate means "create volume group", lvcreate means "create logical volume".

1. Use `lvremove /dev/vg0/debian-installer` to remove the logical volume created before.

1. Use `dpkg-divert --list` to list all diversions, and `dpkg-divert --remove /etc/grub.d/20_linux_xen` to remove a diversion.
