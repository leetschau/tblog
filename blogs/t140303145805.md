# Start a Service and Wait Until It's Up
Tags: Linux; Shell; Port; netcat

------

In this case the GcpServer is a background service. If the port 5556 is listening, that means the service start successfully.

    chmod 755 GcpServerCore/cmd/*.sh
    cd GcpServerCore/cmd;./start.sh;cd -
    while ! nc -zv localhost 5556; do sleep 5; done

This solution based on the netcat utility.
