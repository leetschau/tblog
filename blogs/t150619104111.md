Tails 1.4 can **not** be installed with YUMI.
It will cause a "setup chroot failure".
There is a bug report on Tails for this:
[Chroot browsers don't work when Tails is manually installed with YUMI](https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/9115).

After start up with USB key, press <TAB> after the "BOOT" prompt.
I tried all 3 options. Only "menu_486" could boot the system.

Once logged in, connect WiFi, use "unsafe_browser" to check the internet connection.
If it's OK, use Tor browser.
