# Install

1. Download deb package "x-tile_2.5-1_all.deb" from [x-tile website](http://www.giuspen.com/x-tile/);

1. `sudo dpkg -i x-tile_2.5-1_all.deb`;

Verify: `x-tile -h` with user who has loged into the desktop environment. User root has no desktop environment, so if you run x-tile as root, you get a "Client failed to connect to the D-BUS daemon" error.

# Usage

Use the following command in terminal or input box of the collapsed xfce4-appfinder(Alt-F2):

`x-tile g 2 3`: tile all opened window with 2 rows and 3 columns;

`x-tile g` == `x-tile g 0 0`: tile all opened window with automatic rows and columns;

`x-tile y`: cycle the order of last tiling operation;

`x-tile m`: maximize all opened window;

`x-tile M`: unmaximize all opened window;
