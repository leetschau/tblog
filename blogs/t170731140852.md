# Restart Network on Ubuntu

# Ubuntu 16.04

Today I can't ssh to a Ubuntu server (named *alpha*) on QingCloud,
and can't connect to it via `ping` command.
The VPN is good because I can access web service on another host
in the same LAN on QingCloud.
The alpha host itself is OK because I can login to it via the web
console of QingCloud.
After running command `ping baidu.com`, I got `network unreachable`.
So it's clear that its network service is down.

To restart the network service, run:
`sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager.service`.
It works. Now I can logon this host via ssh.

# Ubuntu 14.04

Sometimes the Dell laptop can't connect to WiFi,
run `sudo service network-manager restart` and it then connect successfully.
