# Using Emacs as Clojure IDE
Tags: clojure;IDE;emacs;nrepl

------

1. Open emacs24;

1. Change CWD to parent folder of project home: M-x cd<CR> ~/docs/tmp<CR>;

1. Build a leiningen project: M-! lein new calc-cov (see Run Shell Command in
   Emacs for other method to run shell command in emacs);

1. Change CWD to project home: M-x cd<CR> calc-cov<CR>;

1. Start nrepl server: M-x nrepl-jack-in;

1. Open source file in another window: C-x 2 C-x C-f src/.../core.clj;

1. Change the namespace of the REPL to the namespace of the file you are in:
   `C-c M-n`

1. Evaluate the whole source file: C-c C-k, evaluate a s-exp before the cursor:
   `C-x C-e`

1. Open clojure doc of the function under the cursor: C-c C-d

1. Run test: C-c C-,

# Frequently used keyboard shortcuts and commands

* Toggle focus between nrepl window and clojure source file window:
  `C-c C-z` (you should add "(add-to-list 'same-window-buffer-names "*nrepl*")"
  to ~/.emacs;

* Always pretty printing in the REPL: M-x nrepl-toggle-pretty-printing

* Move over sexp: C-M-b/C-M-f;

* Interrupt any pending evaluations: C-c C-b;

# Evaluate a sexp without evaluate all file

1. Add this sexp into source file (unnecessary to save source file);

1. Use following methods to evaluate the sexp:

* Move cursor to the sexp for test, C-M-x (or C-c C-c) to evaluate the top-level
  form (such as a defn expression) under the cursor;
  If you want insert the evaluation result to current buffer, use C-u C-M-x;

* If the the target form is not a "top-level" form, move the cursor to the
  **end** of this sexp, C-x C-e to evaluate it, See more shortcuts at
  [nrepl official site](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/nrepl.el);

Then this sexp has been added to the repl, you can use it in repl;

This is very helpful in some circumstances. For example, I want debug function
"cell-block" (see p141 in "Clojure Programming"), add 

    (println "[left mid right] is:") 
    (println [left mid right]) 

before "(window (map ...)". But You can't evaluate the whole file because there
are some lazy sequences and evaluate whole file will cause JVM heap out of memory;
So I only evaluate this modified version with C-x C-e, test it in repl.
After I figure out how this function works, undo my modification and move on.

Note:

* In clojure mode with Evil, you have to switch to insert state and put the
  cursor **after** the last parenthsis, then evaluate the expression with
  `C-x C-e`. If you put the cursor **on** the last parenthesis in normal state,
  The result will be wrong.

* It unnecessary to put your clojure file in a leiningen-created project,
  which is more flexible than vim-fireplace;

* The value of expression will be output to the *message* area
  (bottom of the emacs window), while the output by "println"
  will be output to nrepl buffer;

* Switch cursor between windows: C-x o;

* Clear repl output: C-c M-o;

* Indent code blocks intelligently: C-M-q

* All the keyboard shortcuts will be more convenient if you swap CapsLock key
  and Escape key, together with Ctrl key and Alt key, see Define Keymap on Ubuntu for detail;
