# Install R and run

On Linux:
```
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install r-base
$ R
```

On Windows:
```
choco install r.project
choco install r.studio
```

## Install RStudio Server on Ubuntu

```
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install r-base
$ sudo apt-get install gdebi-core
$ wget https://download2.rstudio.org/rstudio-server-1.1.383-amd64.deb
$ sudo gdebi rstudio-server-1.1.383-amd64.deb
$ sudo echo "r-libs-user=~/.RPackages" >> /etc/rstudio/rsession.conf
$ sudo rstudio-server restart
```

Login RStudio in browser at "<server-ip>:8787" with Ubuntu username
and password.

Note 1:
If not modify the default personal package directory in file
`/etc/rstudio/rsession.conf`, the new installed package will be saved
in folder `~/R`.

Note 2:
List all `rstudio-server` subcommmands with `sudo rstudio-server help`.

Note 3: Specify another server port instead of 8787 in file
`/etc/rstudio/rserver.conf`. See all configuration items in
[RStudio Server: Configuring the Server](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200552316-Configuring-the-Server).

# Frequently used command

```
version
.libPaths()
installed.packages()[,c(1,3:4)]
getwd()
setwd("temp")  # set working directory
```

## Get the package name which a specific object belongs to

For example, I want to get the name of the package where the function `acf()`
defined in. In R console, run `?acf`, get the package name (`stats`) at the
first line of the function's documentation in the *Help* window:
`acf {stats}`, and the last line of the doc:
`[Package stats version 3.2.3 Index]`.

Or run `??acf` to get all similar function list in the *Help* window,
here you can see `stats::acf` in the function list.

These methods also works for data object. For example,
run `?women` and `??women` you can see it's defined in package *datasets*.


# Explore data frame

```
str(women)           # list all column names, types and some data
head(women, n)       # first n rows
attributes(women)    # list all attributes (metadata) of an object,
                     #   such as names, dimension, class, row.names, etc.
names(women)         # get the *name* attribute of an object
dim(women)           # get the *dimension* attribute of an object (row and column number)
class(women)         # get the *class* attribute of an object
nrow(women)
ncol(women)
colnames(women)      # column names
summary(women)
women[sample(nrow(women), 3), ]  # sample 3 rows randomly
library("dplyr")
sample_n(women, 3)               # another way for sampling via package dplyr
```

# typeof(), mode() & class()

'mode' is a mutually exclusive classification of objects according to their
basic structure. The 'atomic' modes are numeric, complex, charcter and logical.
Recursive objects have modes such as 'list' or 'function' or a few others.
An object has one and only one mode.

`typeof()` and `mode()` are basically the same with some differences,
see `?mode` for details. The return values of these functions are in a small set,
such as "integer", "double", "logical", "character", "list", "closure"(function), etc.

'class' is a property assigned to an object that determines how generic
functions (such as `summary()`) operate with it.
It is not a mutually exclusive classification.
If an object has no specific class assigned to it, such as a simple numeric
vector, it's class is usually the same as its mode, by convention.

Changing the mode of an object is often called 'coercion'.
The mode of an object can change without necessarily changing the class. e.g:
```
> x <- 1:8
> mode(x)
[1] "numeric"
> class(x)
[1] "integer"
> dim(x) <- c(2,4)
> mode(x)
[1] "numeric"
> class(x)
[1] "matrix"
> is.numeric(x)
[1] TRUE
> mode(x) <- "character"
> mode(x)
[1] "character"
> class(x)
[1] "matrix"
```

# Data Types

1-dimensional: vector(`c(...)`), list(`list(...)`);

2-dimensional: matrix(`maxtrix(...)`), data.frame(`data.frame(...)`);

n-dimensional: array(`array(...)`).
