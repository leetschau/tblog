John Hughes: Why Functional Programming Matters

 

* The key points of a programming language is its modularization capability: it can divide a big problem into some smaller sub-problems; then glue them together. "Modularity is the key to successful programming. Languages that aim to improve productivity must support modular programming well."

 

* FP language has 2 ways to glue sub-problems together:

 

 + High-order functions: the functions using other functions as its parameter(s);

 

 + Lazy evaluation: the generator-selector model;

 

# Analysis of "4.1 Newton-Raphson Square Roots"

 

Convert the functions of Newton-Raphson algorithm in this paper into Clojure functions:

 

 next n x = (x + n/x)/2 => #(/ (+ % (/ n %)) 2)

 repeat (next n) a0 => (iterate #(/ (+ % (/ n %)) 2) a0)

 

So the 8th iteration in decimal is:

 

 (double (nth (iterate #(/ (+ % (/ n %)) 2) a0) 8)) 

 

Here the point is the function "iterate" returns a **lazy** sequence, which is to say, if you evaluate "(iterate inc 5)" in clojure repl, you got a infinite list (you have to press Ctrl-c to interrupt the output). You use "nth" to get the nth element in this list without worrying about your memory space.
