# Define hostname on every node

Add "HOSTNAME=cloud60" into file /etc/sysconfig/network on host 10.12.2.60. Then reboot system.
Do this with it's own hostname on every node.

# Add host name to every node

Add /etc/hosts to every node:

    10.12.2.60 cloud60
    10.12.2.61 cloud61
    10.12.2.62 cloud62
    10.12.2.63 cloud63
    10.12.2.90 cloud90
    10.12.2.91 cloud91
    10.12.2.92 cloud92
    10.12.2.93 cloud93

where 10.12.2.60 is the manager node (where the cloudera manager is installed).

# Local Repository

Copy DVD iso file to manager node, mount it. Create a link of /mnt/cdrom to /var/www/html with httpd:

    # mkdir /mnt/cdrom
    # mount -o loop /path/to/CentOS6.3-DVD.iso /mnt/cdrom
    # cd /var/www/html
    # ln -s /mnt/cdrom cdrom

Then add file cdrom.repo under /etc/yum.repos.d/:

    [cdrom]
    name = CDROM
    baseurl = http://10.12.2.60/cdrom/
    gpgcheck = 0

# Other notes

* Add user "boco" to "sudoers" on all nodes: add "boco ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" to /etc/sudoers;

* The manager node can ssh to any other node with no password (ssh-copy-id ...);

* SSH from normal node to manager node to remove "are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?" prompt;

* Shutdown iptables on all nodes: `service iptables stop` and `chkconfig iptables off`;
