# Communicate System Clipboard with Vim in Linux

# Linux Mint Xfce

By default, Ubuntu (so as to Linux Mint) installs the vim-tiny package, which is a ultra-light version of the console "vim" only.

To check the clipboard support of the installed vim, run `vim --version|grep clipboard`.
If you get "-clipboard" and "-xterm_clipboard", your vim can't support system clipboard.
You have to remove current vim, and install a "full" version vim like this:

    $ sudo apt-get purge vim 
    $ sudo apt-get autoremove # remove related packages of vim 
    $ sudo apt-get install vim-gtk # gtk suited for Xfce environments

Now let's check:
 
    $ vim --version | grep clipboard 

You should get something like "+clipboard" and "+xterm_clipboard". 

Now connect vim clipboard with that of system with adding "set clipboard=unnamedplus" into you ~/.vimrc. And check it:

1. Copy texts in web browser with Ctrl-c, and use "p" to paste them in vim;

1. copy a line in vim with "yy", then paste them into some GUI program (say, gedit) with Ctrl-v.

# ArchLinux

Install gvim with `sudo pacman -S gvim`.

Note: On CentOS, use `yum search vim` to get the exact vim package name. On CentOS 6.4 it's "vim-X11".
