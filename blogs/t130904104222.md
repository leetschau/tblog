Now ControlTier is replaced by rundeck.org.

 

Fabic is another good tool based on Python. It has a fexpect component to do expect-like automation tasks. Fabric is "push" model, see [Puppet vs Fabric for deploys](http://mattcallanan.blogspot.com/2013/03/puppet-vs-fabric-for-deploys.html);

 

[RunDeck Plugin of Jenkins](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/RunDeck+Plugin) give a good example of "0-click" deployment.

 

[A simple introduction to fabric](http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/671) give a good explanation of how to use fabric to do deploying jobs.

 

[Func](https://fedorahosted.org/func/) is "Fedora Unified Network Controller", so it's suited on rpm-based Linux.

 

[SmartFrog](http://www.smartfrog.org/) is a Java-based tool, we can use it with Fabric.

 

[Salt Stack](http://saltstack.com/) is also a candidate, support push and pull models(http://serverfault.com/questions/415713/what-advantages-features-does-puppet-or-chef-offer-over-salt-or-vice-versa). It has nice Chinese support, see [Salt介绍](http://wiki.saltstack.cn/).
