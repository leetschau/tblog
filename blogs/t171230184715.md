# List Largest Files Recursively in a Folder
Tags: shell; size; files

------

In shell, to list the files in a folder recursively ordered by size
(excluding sub-folders), run the following command:
`find . -type f -exec du -h -a {} + | sort -hr | head`

See [Using semicolon (;) vs plus (+) with exec in find](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6085156/using-semicolon-vs-plus-with-exec-in-find)
for the meaning of `{}` and `+` in the `exec` clause of `find` command.

Verified in bash and zsh.
