# Rearrange Disk Partitions

Start computer with gparted LiveCD and start GParted. The data partition is "/dev/sda1".

1. Use "Resize/Move" to move /dev/sda1 partition to the end of the disk, before the swap partition. Shrink 928GB to 295GB, where 87GB are used. It took about 5 hours. You can only shrink the partition without moving them to the end, which will be faster than the previous "shrink + move" method.

1. Right click /dev/sda1 -> Manage Flags, uncheck the "boot" flag.

1. Create a new 50GB partition /dev/sda3 with EXT4 format, label it as "system1" and quit GParted;

1. Start computer with new system (Mint 17 64bit here) LiveCD;

1. Install Mint, select "Something else" when asked for "Installation type";

1. Select /dev/sda3, click "change", then choose "Ext4 journaling file system" in "Use as", then choose "/" as the "Mount point", set /dev/sda1 mounted at /home and the old swap partition as swap;

1. Install the system, then reboot;

## Transfer old data

The old partition is mounted on /home, so the old home folder is now /home/home/chad. So we need:

1. Move sub-folders of /home/home/chad to /home/chad; 

1. After some days when it's sure all data have been transfered, delete all folders and files under /home except "chad" (new $HOME folder);

Now on /dev/sda3, there is only one folder "chad". When install the second system, just mount /dev/sda3 to /home, everything will be ok.

## Supported methods for disk partition management

Start "Terminal" on LiveCD.

1. Detect disk: `gdisk /dev/sda`, notice  your detection target is the whole disk instead of a partition, so "sda" can't be written as "sda1", or there will no MBR be found.

1. Backup MBR: `sfdisk -d /dev/sda > parts.txt`, you can recover MBR with `sfdisk /dev/sda < backup-sda.sfdisk` , or with "dd" command:

    Backup: # dd if=/dev/sda of=/backup/mbr_sda.bak bs=512 count=1
    Restore: # dd if=/backup/mbr_sda.bak of=/dev/hda bs=512 count=1

# Install the Second OS

1. Backup MBR and grub.cfg: 

1. Install centOS 6.5 Minimal with USB stick;

1. Choose "Create Custom Layout", create a new partititon, mounted at /, and mount sdb1 as /home;

1. Uncheck "Install boot loader on /dev/sdb";

1. Reboot system. There is no change in boot menu, startup origin system (Mint 17), run `update-grub` with root.

1. Reboot, you can see the CentOS is in boot menu.

Note: If you don't want an OS in your boot menu, rename its "boot" folder as "boot.old" (or anything else).
