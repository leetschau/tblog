# Make an Application AutoStart in Unity Desktop
Tags: autostart; unity; ubuntu

------

To make an application autostart in Unity,
you can define it in "Startup Applications" in Dash (start with win key).

When you want to define it with more options (delay time after startup,
for example), or want to create it with shell scripts,
you can add a "desktop" file under `~/.config/autostart/`.

For example, execute a shell script to swap Capslock and ESC key:

    $ cat $HOME/.config/autostart/.desktop
    [Desktop Entry]
    Name=WizNote
    Comment=WizNote
    Icon=WizNote
    Exec=WizNote
    Terminal=false
    Type=Application
    X-GNOME-Autostart-Delay=7

Here we set the delay to 7 seconds after login.
Verified in Ubuntu 14.04, Dell E7450 laptop.

See note "Define Keymap on Ubuntu and Windows" for
an example of autostarting shell script.
