# Copy Full Path Name of a File in Ranger
Tags: copy; linux; xsel

------

After version 1.4.0, ranger add a command `yp` to copy full path name of
the selected file with xsel.

Install xsel (`apt-get install xsel`), and modify command of `yp` to copy
the slected filename to system clipboard instead of only the PRIMARY clipboard:
Create file `$HOME/.config/ranger/rc.conf`, add the following line:
`map yp shell -d echo -n %d/%f | xsel -i -p -b`.

Or modify the system-level config file (not recommended):
in file `/etc/ranger/config/rc.conf`,
modify `map yp shell -d echo -n %d/%f | xsel -i` to:
`map yp shell -d echo -n %d/%f | xsel -i -p -b`.

Add `-p -b` to command `yd` and `yn` as well.
Here `-p` means copy to `PRIMARY` clipboard,
while `-b` means copy to system clipboard.

Now use `yp` (or `yn`) to copy full path (or filename),
and Ctrl-Shift-v (in console) or Ctrl-v (in GUI app) to paste.

Note: See manpage of xsel for the concept of 3 different clipboard PRIMARY,
SECONDARY and CLIPBOARD of X windows.
