# Get Overall CPU Usage on Linux
Tags: linux; cpu; top

------

Run the following command to get the overall CPU usage from command line:

    top -bn2|grep "Cpu(s)"|sed "s/.*, *\([0-9.]*\)%* *id.*/\1/"|awk '{print 100 - $1 "%"}'|sed -n 2p

You can see the result is extracted from "top" command. You can study this command section by section. The first step is `top -bn2`, which print 2 frame of "top" command to console instead of to curses window.

Here we use "-bn2" instead of "-bn1" is because the first ouput is always inaccurate. See comments in [How to get overall CPU Usage (e.g. 57%) on Linux](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9229333/how-to-get-overall-cpu-usage-e-g-57-on-linux#9229692) for details.

The second step is `top -bn2|grep "Cpu(s)"`, the 3rd step is `top -bn2|grep "Cpu(s)"|sed "s/.*, *\([0-9.]*\)%* *id.*/\1/"`, etc.
