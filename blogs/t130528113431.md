# exo-open

exo-open is a powerful and build-in command-line launcher in Xfce,
like Executor on Windows. You can see `man exo-open` or
http://docs.xfce.org/xfce/xfce4-appfinder/preferences for details.
For example, the difference of %s and %S. 

## Custom Actions
 
You can define some custom actions in Application Finder,
then trigger it with "Alt + F2" and some text. 
Defining custom actions like as follows:

Application Finder(Alt + F3) ->
Preferences(A button on Application Finder window) -> Custom Actions: 

### search things with web browser 

Type: Prefix 
Pattern: s. 
Command: firefox 'http://www.bing.com/search?q=%s'

or:  exo-open --launch WebBrowser 'http://www.google.com.hk/search?q=%s' 
note: you can try to start google search from command line by some script,
see http://www.if-not-true-then-false.com/2009/google-search-from-linux-and-unix-command-line/ 

### Run a terminal command 

this is a build-in example in Mint 14. 
Type: Prefix 
Pattern: ! 
Command: exp-open --launch TerminalEmulator %s 
note: so you can write a file in vi by this: Alt + F2, !vi 

### open a directory 

Type: Prefix 
Pattern: / 
Command: exo-open --launch FileManager %S 

Note1: here if you input "/opt/jre-1.6", then the first charactor "/" is
part of your command, so you have to use %S instead of %s. 

Note2: you can use keyboard to location folders in
[Thunar](http://docs.xfce.org/xfce/thunar/start), the file manager of Xfce. 

### Open SVN Repository with rabbitvcs

Type: Prefix 
Pattern: svn. 
Command: rabbitvcs browser http://10.0.2.59:8118/svn/%s

Note: you have to install rabbitvcs with apt-get.

## Run a GUI app

Application Finder(Alt + F3) -> keyboard -> Application Shortcuts:

1. Click "Add"; 

1. Command: "exo-open --launch FileManager /home/chad/apps/eclipse-java-juno-SR2-linux-gtk/eclipse",
   or "exo-open './docs/learn_you_erlang.pdf'", or
   "exo-open --launch TerminalEmulator xfce4-terminal --fullscreen" to open
   terminal in fullscreen mode, `man xfce4-terminal` for full launch options;

1. Press "OK";

1. Shortcuts: press key combinations you choose;
 
# gmrun

Install it with the name "gmrun" in Software Manager;

You can use ! to turn on "Search" mode to search in your command history;

Ctrl+Enter works fine for terminal command (like vi, or you can append
"read -p somePromp" to your command to prevent window vanish);

# verve

It can be embedded into pannel; 

Add a command "verve-focus" to "Keyboard -> Application Shortcuts" to
focus verve with a keyboard shortcut;

Install it with the name "verve" in Software Manager (full name is "xfce4-verve-plugin);

Ctrl+Enter (run command in terminal) does not work;
