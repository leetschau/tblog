# Notes about "Seven Languages in Seven Weeks"

# day 1 
* Print the string “Hello, world.” 
 puts "Hello, world." 
* For the string “Hello, Ruby,” find the index of the word “Ruby.” 
 "Hello, Ruby.".index("Ruby") 
* Print your name ten times. 
 10.times{puts "Li Chao"} 
* Print the string “This is sentence number 1,” where the number 1 changes from 1 to 10. 
 (0..10).each do |i| 
  puts "This is sentence number #{i}" 
 end 
or: 
 for i in 0..10 
  puts "This is sentence number #{i}" 
 end 
* Run a Ruby program from a file. 
save ex.rb with: 
 for i in 0..10 
  puts "This is sentence number #{i}" 
 end 
then run: jruby ex.rb 
* Bonus problem: If you’re feeling the need for a little more, write a program that picks a random number. Let a player guess the number, telling the player whether the guess is too low or too high.(Hint: rand(10) will generate a random number from 0 to 9, and gets will read a string from the keyboard that you can translate to an integer.) 
 target = rand(10) 
 puts "Please input a number between 0~10:" 
 i = gets.chomp.to_i 
 while i != target 
  if i<target 
   puts "lower" 
  else puts "higher" 
  end 
  i = gets.chomp.to_i 
 end 
 puts "You got it: #{i}"
