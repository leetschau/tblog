After start up Arch Linux host, plugin the ethernet cable, the lights of network interface card is off. Now run command 

    ip link set enp0s25 up

the lights will turned on. Then run 

    dhcpcd enp0s25

Now the host will get a IP. If you can ping 8.8.8.8 (which is google's dns server), but not www.baidu.com, you have to assign a valid DNS provider. Using OpenDNS is a safe solution. So add the following lines into /etc/resolv.conf:

    nameserver 208.67.222.222
    nameserver 208.67.220.220
