# System-wide environment variables

Add global environment variables in file **/etc/environment**.
This file is specifically meant for system-wide environment variable settings.
It is **not** a script file, but rather consists of assignment expressions, one per line:

    JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/default-java

So do not add "export" before assignments. Variable expansion does **not** work in this file.

# User specific environment variables

Add user level environment variables in file **~/.zshenv**. For example, to override system PATH:

    export PATH=$HOME/apps/spark-1.0.2-bin-hadoop2/bin:$PATH

# User aliases setup

For bash there is a ~/.bash_aliases file, so we define aliases in this file, and load it in zsh with adding following codes into ~/.zshrc:

    if [ -f ~/.bash_aliases ]; then
        . ~/.bash_aliases
    fi

Some example in ~/.bash_aliases:

    alias gst='git status'
    alias dn='$HOME/apps/dsnote/donshell.sh'
