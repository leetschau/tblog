# Paredit

[ParEdit](http://www.emacswiki.org/ParEdit), a.k.a. "structured editing",
is some special editing operations for S-expression coding,
like Lisp or Clojure. Mainstream IDEs all have support for paredit.

## Eclipse

Install clojure IDE plugin [counterclockwise](https://code.google.com/p/counterclockwise/).
It's default shortcuts is listed in [Editor Keyboard Shortcuts](http://doc.ccw-ide.org/keyboard-shortcuts.html);

## Cursive

Cursive: install IntelliJ and Cursive plugin, see default shortcuts definition
at [Structural editing](https://cursiveclojure.com/userguide/paredit.html);

# REPL for Ring Application

Say the application name is "guestbook" (based on "Web Development with Clojure"
by Dmitri Sotnikov).

## Eclipse

The counterclockwise plugin need to be installed beforehand.

1. Build a new "Clojure Project" with name "guestbook", set "Leiningen template" as "compojure-app";

1. Open guestbook.routes.home.clj, and run menu item [Clojure -> Load file in REPL];

1. In REPL window (the window title is "REPL @ nrepl://127.0.0.1:xxxx(guestbook.routes.home)",
   run (use 'guestbook.repl) and (start-server), you can use Ctrl+Up/Down to navigate in command history;

1. See homepage with url "http://localhost:8080";

1. Modify codes, refresh web page to see the result. If this doesn't work,
   close the REPL window and restart server;

## Cursive

1. In terminal: `lein new compojure-app mybook`;

1. In Cursive, import "mybook" via "Import Project",
   choose "Leiningen" for "Import project from external model";

1. Open "Terminal" window in Cursive, run `lein repl`,
   (use 'guestbook.repl) and (start-server);

1. See homepage with url "http://localhost:8080";

1. Modify codes, refresh web page to see the result. If this doesn't work,
   restart server in "Terminal" window;

Note: I've tried [Light Table](http://www.lighttable.com/).
It can open the guestbook project created by leiningen, but can't connect to it.
So I give it up, and use Eclipse instead.
