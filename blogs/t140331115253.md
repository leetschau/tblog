# Distribute SSH Pubkey to Multiple Hosts with Fabric
Tags: SSH; Fabric

------

1. Generate ssh keys on source host with `ssh-keygen`;

1. Disable known_hosts prompt(optional): add "StrictHostKeyChecking no" into ~/.ssh/config;

1. Run fabric script to distribute pubkey, you have to input password manually: `fab distkey`;

$ cat fabfile.py
from fabric.api import local, task
env.hosts = ['10.0.2.48', '10.0.2.49', '10.0.7.141', '10.0.7.142', '10.0.7.143']
@task
def distkey():
    env.user = 'gcp'
    local('ssh-copy-id %(user)s@%(host)s' % env)

You have to input password for every host. So try to use uniform password for all hosts. It will save you lots of times.
