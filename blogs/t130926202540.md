# Difference of cons and conj in Clojure
Tags: clojure

------

conj put collection as its first argument while cons put collection as its second argument.

 

Synopsis:

 

conj <collection> element1 element2 ...

 

cons element <collection>

 

Meanwhile this post from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3008411/clojure-seq-cons-vs-list-conj give other 2 important difference:

 

One difference is that conj accepts any number of arguments to insert into a collection, while cons takes just one:

 

(conj '(1 2 3) 4 5 6) 
; => (6 5 4 1 2 3) 
(cons 4 5 6 '(1 2 3)) 
; => IllegalArgumentException due to wrong arity 
Another difference is in the class of the return value: 
(class (conj '(1 2 3) 4)) 
; => clojure.lang.PersistentList 
(class (cons 4 '(1 2 3)) 
; => clojure.lang.Cons
