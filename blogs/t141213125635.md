# Connect to Wireless Network in Linux Mint Command Line
Tags: wifi; mint; scan

------

Show current network status of the computer: `nmcli c status`, `nmcli nm` and `nmcli d`;

List all available Wi-Fi access points: `nmcli dev wifi`.
The first column is the SSID Name which will be used in the following steps.

Connect to a new (unconnected before) access point:
`nmcli dev wifi connect <SSIDName> password <ThePassword>`.
Or specify the NIC name: 
`nmcli dev wifi con <SSIDName> password <ThePassword> iface wlan0`.
replace "wlan0", "SSIDName" and "MyPassword" with yours.

Connect to a used (connected before) access point:
`nmcli con up id <SSIDName>`.

Turn off current connected wifi: `nmcli nm wifi off`.

Next time when connected this wifi, turn on with `nmcli nm wifi on`.

Other unverified versions:

    nmcli d wifi connect <WiFi-ESSID> password <WiFi-Password> iface wlan0
    iwconfig wlan0 essid <WiFi-ESSID> key <WiFi-Password>

Note:

`iwlist wlan0 scan|grep ESSID` only list the connected Wifi, instead of all available Wi-Fi access points.

Ref:

`man nmcli`;
