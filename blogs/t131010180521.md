# Installation

On Linux Mint 14 Xfce.

## OS verification

    $ lsb_release -a

The codename of Linux Mint 14 is "Nadia". Google "linux mint release" shows Nadia based on Ubuntu Quantal(12.10), which is in the supported version of puppet 3. 

## Install it in standalone mode

    $ wget https://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-quantal.deb
    $ sudo dpkg -i puppetlabs-release-quantal.deb
    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install puppet-common

You have to run puppet command as root: `puppet apply -e 'notice ("Hello World")'`. 

## On Master Node

After update apt repo:

    # apt-get install puppetmaster
    # puppet master --version
    # apt-get install puppetmaster-passenger (failed on my laptop)

Verify as root: 

    # service puppetmaster status

Start it in foreground:

    # service puppetmaster stop
    # puppet master --no-daemonize --verbose

## On Agent Node

    # apt-get install puppet

Verify as root:

    # service puppet status
    # puppet agent --test --server=10.21.2.7

You will meet a "no certificate found and waitforcert is disabled" error. So we let master sign the certificate for the agent.

## Signing the Certificate

On master:

    # puppet cert list

You get the agent's name. It's OK.

    # puppet cert sign chadpc527.boco.com

On agent:

    # puppet apply -e '...'

# Trouble Shooting

Log file: /var/log/puppet/masterhttp.log

Default puppet master port: 8140

Port detection: lsof -wni tcp:8140

Regenerate certificate request of agent: rm -rf /var/lib/puppet/ssl
