# Penetrate GFW with sshuttle
Tags: gfw; sshuttle

------

Comparing with shadowsocks, [sshuttle](https://github.com/apenwarr/sshuttle) is
a much lightweight, open source alternative.
All you need is a ssh server outside GFW.

To install, `git clone` its repository from github, or use `pip install`.

Then run the following command on client:
`sshuttle --dns -r username@sshServer -x 192.168.0.0/16 -x 127.0.0.1 -D 0/0`.

Here option "--dns" is necessary to avoid DNS pollution inside GFW.
Add `-v` or `-vv` option ONLY for debug purpose, for it decreases connecting speed a lot.
`-r` means "remote", so add your remote host outside GFW after it.
`-x` means excluding all IPs in 192.168.x.x and localhost from forwarding.
`-D` means start server as a daemon.
The last part of this command specifies which connections on client to use
by this proxy, "0/0" means all connections, which is the most common case.

For convenience, add the following lines into ~/.bash_aliases:
```
alias sv="sshuttle --dns -r username@sshServer -x 192.168.0.0/16 -x 127.0.0.1 -D 0/0"
alias lv="pgrep sshuttle"
alias kv="pkill sshuttle"
```

Now you can use `sv` to *start* the vpn,
                `lv` to *list* vpn,
            and `kv` to *kill* vpn.
