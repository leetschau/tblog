# From Windows to Linux

Download [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) Windows installer (7z920-x64.msi for now) and install it.

Create archive file in "7z" format.

On Linux, extract it with `7z x mypkg.7z`.
Or test it with `7z l mypkg.7z`.

Note: You can create zip file with 7-Zip as well,
but it can't handle Chinese filename correctly on Linux.

# From Linux to Windows

Install 7-Zip on Mint: `sudo aptitude install p7zip-full`;

> p7zip is command line port of 7-Zip for POSIX systems, including Linux.

Create archive file "myPkg.zip" from path "targetPath":
`7z a filename.zip targetPath`;

7z and zip format both handle Chinese filename correctly.

On Windows, install 7-Zip (see above section), and extract it with it.
