# A Telnet Client Using Expect
Tags: expect;telnet

------

The following expect script achieves a simple telnet client: login -> send command -> exit. The point is the form of prompt in regular expression. You have to add 3 backslash before "[", "]" and "$", and add "-re" option after expect command in "expect $prompt".

 

 #!/usr/bin/expect 
 set prompt "\\\[hadoop@49server\\s.*\\\]\\\$\\s" 
 spawn telnet 10.0.2.49 
 expect "login:" 
 send "hadoop\r" 
 expect "Password:" 
 send "h\r" 
 expect -re $prompt 
 send "df -h\r" 
 expect -re $prompt 
 send "ls -l\r" 
 expect -re $prompt 
 send "exit\r" 
 expect eof 
 

The following script achieves auto-login and auto-logout. Save it as autoTelnet.exp:

 

 #!/usr/bin/expect 
 set ip [lindex $argv 0] 
 set username [lindex $argv 1] 
 set password [lindex $argv 2] 
 spawn telnet $ip 
 expect "login:" 
 send "$username\r" 
 expect "Password:" 
 send "$password\r" 
 interact +++ return 
 send "exit\r" 
 expect eof 

 

then run it:

 

 $ ./autoTelnet.exp 10.0.2.49 hadoop h

 

After auto-login, you can send any commands as if you communicates with host directly. When you want to quit, type "+++" and then the script exits from interact mode and runs logout routine.
