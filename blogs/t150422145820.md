the second one is for editing the screenshot.

# Usage

Take a screenshot with `shutter -s -d 5 -o output.png -e`,
which has a 5s delay with option `-d 5`,
`-s` means *Selection* method, `-e` means *exit after capture*.

Or use it with GUI: run `shutter` in dmenu, click "Selection" on toolbar.

Shutter is a multi-tab application, and save picture to disk automatically,
which is very convenient.
