Use banshee to sync between laptop and ipod. Banshee is a build-in application of Mint 14. It can copy songs on ipod to laptop (default music library on disk is ~/Music). So if you want add some songs to ipod:

 

1. Plug ipod to USB port of your laptop;

 

1. Start banshee, you can see your ipod name ("chadpod" for me) under the "Devices" on the left column of banshee panel;

 

1. Make sure all the songs on your ipod have been added to banshee library. If not, drag the songs from ipod to "Libraries -> Music";

 

1. Select your ipod, under "Sync Preferences", modify the value of "Music" from "Manage manually" to "Sync from ???Recently Added???", then click "Sync" button at the upper-right corner of the panel;

 

1. Click "Disconnect" button nearby the "Sync" button, then unplug the ipod from USB port of your laptop;

 

Note: Use "EasyTag" to modify file tags;
