# Add Xfce Desktop Environment for ArchLinux
Tags: archlinux; xfce

------

After install ArchLinux and awesome, in console, run following as root:

```
pacman -S xfce4 xfce4-goodies variety networkmanager network-manager-applet xfce4-notifyd gnome-keyring
systemctl enable NetworkManager
systemctl start NetworkManager
```

Without gnome-keyring, you can find wireless hot-point, but you will disconnecting from it immediately.

Add "exec startxfce4" in ~/.xinitrc. Then run "startx" in console.

# Dell PC

## Video

You need install video drivers and fonts for this DELL PC.

Firstly, use `lspci|grep VGA` to get video driver information, for example,
for "Intel Corporation 4 Series Chipset Integrated Graphics Controller",
you need to install "xf86-video-intel",
see [Intel Graphics on Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Intel_Graphics#Installation).

## Font

Use "dajavu" to make font in Xfce desktop nicer,
the second make system display Chinese character properly.

```
pacman -S ttf-dejavu adobe-source-han-sans-otc-fonts
// or adobe-source-han-sans-cn-fonts for only Chinese character
pacman -S ttf-ubuntu-font-family
// good-looking fonts for Variety: Ubuntu Condensed
```

## Time

    # timedatectl status
    # timedatectl list-timezones
    # timedatectl set-timezone Asia/Hong_Kong

## Web browser

    # pacman -S firefox    // chromium can't display Chinese character properly

## Other

    # pacman -S git openssh

## Input Method

    # pacman -S fcitx-im fcitx-configtool fcitx-googlepinyin fcitx-libpinyin

Search "archlinux fcitx" on Arch Wiki for installation details.

For now fcitx is much better than ibus.

    # pacman -S ibus-libpinyin
    # su - chad
    $ ibus-setup

Then select "Chinese - Intelligent Pinyin" under "Input Method" tab, and click "Preferences" to customize it.
The package "ibus-sunpinyin" is OK, too.
"ibus-pinyin" can't work properly.
"ibus-rime" can only input traditional Chinese.
