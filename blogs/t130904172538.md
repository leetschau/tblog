# Test "With" Statement of Fabric

When running fabric command on remote host, if the current directory after "with cd(...)" will return to original one? Let's test it.

fabfile.py

    from __future__ import with_statement 
    from fabric.api import local, settings, abort, run, cd 
    def testcd(path): 
        run("pwd") 
        run("ls -l") 
        with cd(path): 
            run("pwd") 
            run("ls -l") 
        run("pwd") 
        run("ls -l") 

Now run `fab -H 10.0.7.142 -u gcp -p gcp@123 testcd:path="zdjk"`. The "pwd" and "ls" before and after "with" statement give the same result, which means "cd" in "with" statement only take effect in "with" block. It's cool.
