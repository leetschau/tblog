# Install xlsx Package for RStudio Server
Tags: rlang; rstudio; ubuntu

------

The package *xlsx* need another package `rJava`, which need JDK,
so you have to install JDK first, then config the path for RStudio,
then restart RStudio server to take effect:
```
sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk
sudo R CMD javareconf
sudo rstudio-server restart
``
