Tags: wps; archlinux; 64bit; 32bit

------

Now WPS is a 32bit application. It's can't run on 64bit ArchLinux.
So firstly we should open the multilib repository of the system. Then install WPS with yaourt.

1. Uncomment the following lines in /etc/pacman.conf:

        [multilib]
        Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist

1. Install WPS: `yaourt -S wpsoffice`;

1. Install printer drivers: `pacman -S libcups`;

1. Install fonts: download wps-office_8.1.0.3724~b1p2_x86.tar.xz from WPS website, unpack it, run `./install_fonts`;

1. Chinese input: `yaourt -S fcitx-wps`. Modify "kingsoft-office" with "wpsoffice" in pkgbuild file of fcitx-wps, because kingsoft-office doesn't exits now.
