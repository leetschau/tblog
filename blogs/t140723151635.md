# Fix NIC Name of Cloned CentOS VMs
Tags: network; interface; config; centos

------

Sometimes the NIC name in output of `ip addr` or `ifconfig` is not the same with that defined in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0, for example, in ifcfg-eth0, the first line is:

    DEVICE="eth0"

but the output of `ip addr` is:

    2: eth1: <BROADCAST...

This is because the source of `ip addr` is /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules. Edit this file to correct the NIC name.

The total step to fix network of a centos VM is:

1. vi /etc/sysconfig/network   // fix hostname and gateway IP

1. vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 // fix NIC name, host IP and netmask

1. vi /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules  // NIC name and hardware address should be the same with that in file ifcfg-eth0

1. reboot

The MAC address is determined by `ifconfig -a`, so copy IP address after "HWaddr" in command output, and modify "HWADDR" in /etc/.../ifcfg-eth0, then `sudo service network restart`.
