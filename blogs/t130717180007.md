# Shutdown a Process Listening at a Port Gracefully
Tags: linux

------

I started a SonarQube process to listening at port 9000. Now I want to restart it for some new installation of plugins. I've forgotten where I installed SonarQube and how start it. The only clue is that it is listening at port 9000. Following is the method to shutdown it gracefully.

1. Find out which process is listening at the port;

`netstat -tulpn | grep :9000` produces:

    tcp6 0 0 :::9000  :::*  LISTEN 19059/java

So now you know the PID is 19059 and the program name is java. You can verify this by the following commands:

    fuser 9000/tcp

or

    lsof -i :9000

1. Get detailed information of the PID: `ps -ef|grep 19059` and produces:

        bvt 19059 19057 ...

This means 19057 is parent of 19059. So we input `ps -ef|grep 19057` and find its parent process is 19001, which parent is 1. Because 1 is init process of OS, we know 19001 is the process we should close.

1. Shutdown a process gracefully: ` kill 19057`;

Note: you can use "pwdx [PID]" to get the current working directory of the PID.
