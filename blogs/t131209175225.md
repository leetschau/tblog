# Functional Programming in Ruby 1.9

------

* Blocks are just a special syntactic sugar in Ruby to create Procs.

 

* Lambdas are really just Procs, but with two important differences:

 

 + Lambdas check the arguments they receive, just like methods. Procs do not. This means if you pass only one argument to a Lambda that takes two arguments, youâ€™ll get an ArgumentError. If you do the same to a Proc, it will just blindly accept the ones you did give, and set the rest of the arguments to nil;

 
 + Any return statements used in a Proc will also return from the method that called that Proc. Lambdas, on the other hand, will not. This means you can call a Lambda, get its return value, and process it, all within the one method; 

 

* Currying is the ability to take a function that accepts n parameters and generate from it one of more functions with some parameter values already filled in. In RUby 1.9, you create a curry-able proc by calling the curry method on it. If you subsequently call this curried proc with fewer parameters than it expects, it will not execute. Instead, it returns a new proc with those parameters already bound;
