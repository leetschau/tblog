CSS selector rules: [CSS Selectors](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp)

CSS Combination rules: [CSS Combinators](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_combinators.asp)

Addition to the above rules, you can use "element.class" to specify a specified elment.
For example, "p.bluecolor" will select "all p elements with class bluecolor".
A <div class="bluecolor"> will not be included.
See [Class selectors](http://css.maxdesign.com.au/selectutorial/selectors_class.htm) for details.
