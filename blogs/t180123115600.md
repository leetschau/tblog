# Estimator, Transformer and Pipeline in Machine Learning

[Main concepts in Pipelines](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-pipeline.html#main-concepts-in-pipelines)
(in Spark Docs > Programming Guides > Machine Learning Library (MLlib) Guide >
ML Pipelines) gives a good introduction to these 3 concepts.

A dataframe is converted to a model (which is a *transformser*) via the *fit()*
method of an *estimator*. A dataframe is converted to another dataframe via the
*transform()* method of a *transformer*. A *pipeline* is an *estimator*,
which is consisted by many *transformer*s and *estimator*s.

The document provides an example of above concepts. A text processing pipeline
built with 2 transformers (*Tokenizer* and *HashingTF*) and an estimator
(*LogisticRegression*). The input of the *fit()* method of the pipeline is raw
text in dataframe.
The output is a model (*transformer*), which is used to predict new text.

As the documents mentioned, the pipeline and related concepts are mostly
inspired by scikit-learn.
So these concepts in scikit-learn have the same meanings.
