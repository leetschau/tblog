# Discovery Scanning

This step find the IP address of a website, most frequently with `ping` tools.

# Port scanning

This step find the openning ports on a host.

## Stealth scan

On Windows, install nmap with `choco install nmap`.

Test a specified port:
Here is port 22 for SSH on host 106.184.7.58 22, equals to  `nc -zv 106.184.7.58 22`:
`nmap -sS -O -p22 106.184.7.58`

Scan commonly used 1000 ports (preconfigured by nmap) of a host: `nmap -sS <target-ip>`;

Scan all port of a host: `nmap -sS <target-ip> -p 0-65535`;

Example:

    $ sudo nmap -sS xxx.xxx.xxx.143 -p 27010-27020

    Starting Nmap 6.40 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2015-03-18 09:01 CST
    Nmap scan report for newfairs.com (xxx.xxx.xxx.143)
    Host is up (0.30s latency).
    PORT      STATE  SERVICE
    27010/tcp closed flexlm10
    27011/tcp closed unknown
    27012/tcp closed unknown
    27013/tcp closed unknown
    27014/tcp closed unknown
    27015/tcp closed unknown
    27016/tcp closed unknown
    27017/tcp open   unknown
    27018/tcp closed unknown
    27019/tcp closed unknown
    27020/tcp closed unknown

    Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 5.66 seconds

Port 27017 (used by mongoDB) is detected.
 
## Connection scan

Command: `nmap -sT <target-ip>`;

Compared with connection scan, stealth scan won't be logged by the target.
So it's more safe.

# Banner grabbing

This step get the banner of a service on a specific port (here is 21):

    sudo nmap -sT xxx.xxx.xxx.234 -p 21 --script=banner

    Starting Nmap 6.40 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2015-03-18 09:30 CST
    Nmap scan report for xxx.xxx.xxx.234
    Host is up (0.064s latency).
    PORT   STATE SERVICE
    21/tcp open  ftp
    | banner: 220-FileZilla Server v0.9.33 beta\x0D\x0A220-written by Tim Kos
    |_se (Tim.Kosse@gmx.de)\x0D\x0A220 Please visit http://sourceforge.net...

So this is a FileZilla server, version 0.9.33,
which implies the OS is probably Windows.

# Service identification

This step detect what service is running on a specific port of a host.

This is the detection on port 3389: `sudo nmap xxx.xxx.xxx.234 -p 3389 -sV`;

Example:

    sudo nmap xxx.xxx.xxx.234 -p 80 -sV                

    Starting Nmap 6.40 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2015-03-18 09:23 CST
    Nmap scan report for xxx.xxx.xxx.234
    Host is up (0.072s latency).
    PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
    80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.2.17 ((Win32) PHP/5.3.5)

# Operating system identification

Command: `nmap <target-ip> -O`;

Example:

    $ sudo nmap xxx.xxx.xxx.143 -O

    Starting Nmap 6.40 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2015-03-18 08:43 CST
    Nmap scan report for xxx.com (xxx.xxx.xxx.143)
    Host is up (0.32s latency).

    No exact OS matches for host (test conditions non-ideal).

    OS detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at http://nmap.org/submit/ .
    Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 83.20 seconds
