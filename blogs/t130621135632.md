# alias

alias is command-line counterpart of hotstring of AutoHotkey, for example:

    alias vboat='vi ~/docs/erlang/boat.erl'

    alias toerl='cd ~/docs/erlang' 

If hope for later use, save them in ~/.bash_aliases(if it's spacified in .bashrc), otherwise, ~/.bashrc.

# CDPATH

$CDPATH to command "cd" is the same with $PATH with executables, or $CLASSPATH to command "java". For example:
 
    bvt@pwm:~/docs/test/workspace$ CDPATH=/usr/share/ant 
    bvt@pwm:~/docs/test/workspace$ cd lib 
    /usr/share/ant/lib 
    bvt@pwm:/usr/share/ant/lib$

Save the value of CDPATH in .bashrc for later use.

# Temporary directories switching

`pushd <dir_name>`: add <dir_name> to path stack and switch to it. For example `pushd .` add current path to path stack;

## Switch between two directories

`pushd`: swap top and second item in stack and switch to second path;

cd -: "-" is $OLDPWD;

## Switch between multiple directories

`pushd +n` or `pushd -n` (n is a 1,2,...): rotates the stack and change to the n-th path in stack, n is decided by `dirs -v` command;

## dirs & popd

`dirs -v`: print the path stack;

See [Linux / Unix Command: pushd](http://linux.about.com/library/cmd/blcmdl1_pushd.htm).
