# Switch User Command in Linux
Tags: 

------

Switch user command (su) has the following forms:

 

# su <username>

 

Switch to <username>, without loading environment variables. If <username> is omitted (only "su"), it equals to "su root";

 

# su - <username>

 


Switch to <username>, and loading environment variables. "-" is the abbreviation of "-l", which means this is a "login" shell, so all .profile will be sourced (man su for details). If <username> is omitted (only "su -"), it equals to "su - root";
 

# su -c "<command>" <username>

 

Run command with the identity of another user. It is mostly used in one-off command with root privileges:

 

 su -c "<command>" root

 

The double quotes around <command> can't be omitted.
