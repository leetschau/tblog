# Unresolved imports in StdDraw3D.java 
download j3d-1_5_2-windows-i586.zip from http://java3d.java.net/binary-builds.html, then extract j3dcore.jar, j3dutils.jar & vecmath.jar from $ZIP_FILE/j3d-jre.zip/lib/ext, then add these jars into classpath of project of StdLib which is built from stdlib-package.jar from official booksite: algs4.cs.princeton.edu.

# How to create a customized Iterable Class 
p141, algorithm 1.1, and corresponding source file ResizingArrayStack.java in downloaded algs4.jar file. 
The "Item" in ResizingArrayStack<Item> is a parameter. That is to say, you can change its name to anything. For example: 
 ResizingArrayStack<T> implements Iterable<T> { ... 
or: 
 ResizingArrayStack<MyItem> implements Iterable<MyItem> { ... 
The method "next()" in private class "ReverseArrayIterator" will not be used in client main method. But we can demonstrate its usage by adding the following snippet in main method: 
 for (String i : s) { 
  System.out.println("i= " + i); 
 }
