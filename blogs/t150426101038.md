# Penetrate GFW with ShadowSocks
Tags: gfw; shadowsocks

------

To browse internet with [shadowsocks](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks),

# Server setup

You need a VPS (buy it from linode or digitalocean, etc, as the outlet),
to run the server with root (say its IP address is "123.234.23.45"):

    # aptitude install python-pip
    # pip install shadowsocks
    # ssserver -p 2043 -k er@20 -m aes-256-cfb --user nobody -d start

See the logs:

    tail -f /var/log/shadowsocks.log

Or start it in foreground:

    # ssserver -p 2043 -k testpwd

# Client

Client is the machine you want to bypass the GFW.

## Windows

Download the client package (Shadowsocks-win-dotnet4.0-2.3.1.zip for now),
extract it, and run.

You can check its "System Proxy" option, which is convenient for all browsers and terminal.

## Linux

### Install

For Ubuntu/Mint:

    $ sudo aptitude install python-pip
    $ sudo pip install shadowsocks

Now you have a socks5 proxy. If you want convert it into a http proxy:

    $ sudo aptitude install polipo
    $ service polipo stop
    $ sslocal -s 123.234.23.45 -p 2043 -b 127.0.0.1 -l 1080 -k testpwd
    $ sudo polipo socksParentProxy=localhost:1080

Now setup the http proxy of your browser as localhost:8123.
To use the proxy in terminal, add prefix "http_proxy=http://localhost:8123",
for example:

    http_proxy=http://localhost:8123 curl www.xys.org

Or use a text-based web browser:

    http_proxy=http://localhost:8123 lynx rsf.org

where 8123 is the default port number of polipo.

[Using Shadowsocks with Command Line Tools](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks/wiki/Using-Shadowsocks-with-Command-Line-Tools) in
[shadowsocks wiki](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks/wiki) use proxychains to achieve proxy in terminal,
which didn't work for me.

To summarize, you need 3 processes to access blocked website on Linux:

1. The shadowsocks server on the VPS abroad;

1. The shadowsocks client on your machine;

1. The polipo to convert a socks proxy into a http proxy.
