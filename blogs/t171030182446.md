# Run Emacs as Daemon
Tags: emacs; daemon; server

------

After installed emacs on a Ubuntu server, I want to use emacs in tmux style.
First SSH to the Ubuntu server, start a emacs daemon with `emacs --daemon`,
and *attach* to it with `emacsclient -t`.
When I need a break, *detach* from the emacs with `C-x 5 0`
(means *kill the frame*), and logout from the Ubuntu server.
When I want to resume,
SSH to the server and *attach* to emacs again with  `emacsclient -t`.

Finally when the job is done, stop the emacs daemon with `M-x kill-emacs`.
