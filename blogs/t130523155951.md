# On Tail Recursion
Tags: erlang;recursion

------

The essential advantage of tail recursion comparing with ordinary recursion is the efficiency. Why time & space cost of tail recursion is linear while ordinary recursion is more? Chapter 5 of "Learn You Some Erlang for Great Good" by Fred Hebert gives a very concise and intuitive answer: tail recursion is "alone". Following is an example of factorial algorithms to show the difference between these two.

 

Ordinary Recursion:

 fac(N) when N > 0 -> N * fac(N-1).

 

Tail Recursion:

 tail_fac(N, Acc) when N > 0 -> tail_fac(N-1, N*Acc).

 

So you see, ordinary recursion is "func(state N) -> do something transformation of func(state N-1)", while tail recursion is "func(state N) -> func(state N-1)". This is exact meaning of "alone" above.
