# Print First and Last Characters of a Line
Tags: shell; linux; print

------

Some large files all content are in the same line,
there is no newline for the entire file.
For them it's very slow to view them with less or vim.
Instead we can use `head` and `tail`,
for example commands below print first and last 50 characters
of a large one-line file:

    cat large-one-line.json|head -c 50
    cat large-one-line.json|tail -c 50
