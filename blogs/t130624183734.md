# Power of Leader Charactor

leader charactor is more convinient than Ctrl+some key:

    let mapleader=","

    nmap <silent> <leader>ev :e $MYVIMRC<CR>  " edit .vimrc with ,ev 
    nmap <silent> <leader>sv :so $MYVIMRC<CR> " make new .vimrc valid with ,sv

    nmap <silent> <leader>sw <C-w>w " use ,sw to switch between window, very useful when using with NERDTree or taglist 


    nmap <leader>no :NERDTree<CR>  " open NERDTree with ,no 
    nmap <leader>nt :NERDTreeToggle<CR>  " toggle NERDTree with ,nt 
    nmap <leader>ob :OpenBookmark " open NERDTree bookmark with ,ob



    nmap <leader>to :TlistOpen<CR>  " open taglist window with ,to 
    nmap <leader>tt :TlistToggle<CR> " toggle taglist window with ,tt 

# Power of map

# Use ; instead of :

a very smart idea to boost vi effiency: `nnoremap ; :`

# Switching Window Faster

    map <C-h> <C-w>h 
    map <C-j> <C-w>j 
    map <C-k> <C-w>k 
    map <C-l> <C-w>l
