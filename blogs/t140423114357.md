# lynx

On Mint: `sudo apt-get install lynx`.

* Getting help: Shift + /;

* Configuration: o (open VI mode here), the configuration file is ~/.lynxrc;

* Move cursor to previous/next link: up/down arrow keys, or j/k if "vi mode" turned on;

* Line up/down: Ctrl-p/n;

* Move backward in history (like backspace in Firefox): left arrow key;

* Quit lynx: q;

* Copy text: drag mouse button;

* Add bookmark: a

* Goto bookmark: v

lynx bookmark can remember file and page position.
While bookmark of elinks only remember file, and always load the first page.
Copying text need only draging mouse, while elinks need pressing shift key at the same time.
So lynx is more convenient than elinks.

# elinks

On Mint: `sudo apt-get install elinks`.

Config key bindings in ~/.elinks/elinks.conf.
Append the following lines into it:

    bind "main" "j" = "move-cursor-down"
    bind "main" "k" = "move-cursor-up"
    bind "main" "K" = "keybinding-manager"

You can use mouse as in the GUI browser.

* Show menu: press <ESC> key;

* Show keybindings: K;

* Line up/down: Ctrl-p/n;

* Quit elinks: q;

* Move cursor to previous/next link: j/k or up/down arrow keys;

* Copy text: press Shift key and drag mouse;

* Copy current page URL(Ctrl-L on Firefox): =, then copy URL;

* Add/Show bookmark: s;

* Set a mark: m followed by a single character, for example "ma", or "mz". The mark only exists within a elinks session. It won't exist after elinks restart.

* Goto a mark: '(single quote). For example: 'a, or 'z. It only works when cursor is in the same frame as it's set.

* Jump to next frame: tab;
