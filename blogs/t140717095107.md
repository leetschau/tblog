Scenario:

    [chad@blackpad rabbitvcs]$ sudo pacman -Syu                                                                                           │··············
    error: GPGME error: No data                                                                                                           │··············
    error: GPGME error: No data                                                                                                           │··············
    error: GPGME error: No data                                                                                                           │··············

    error: GPGME error: No data

Solutions:

    # rm /var/lib/pacman/sync/*db.sig* 
    # pacman-key --init
    # pacman-key --populate archlinux
    # pacman -Syy
    # pacman -Syu

If "File ... is corrupted (invalid or corrupted package (PGP signature))" occured during install a package, when pacman asked "Do you want to delete it? (Y/n)", press <Enter> to delete the file, then run "pacman -S ..." again to reinstall it. I fixed these errors today.
