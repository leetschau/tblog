# View epub and mobi File on Linux
Tags: calibre; epub; mobi; Linux

------

On Ubuntu, the recommended epub viewer is Firefox plugin
[epubreader](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/epubreader/)
or fbreader (`sudo apt-get install fbreader`).
They both have book category to manage books which have been read.

The firefox plugin sometimes displays texts in epub files a mess,
while fbreader always displays in the right way.

Calibre and Okular are both heavy-weight app, large and slow when startup.

Calibre has stand-alone ebook viewer "ebook-viewer", start it in terminal:

    $ ebook-viewer <filename>

I also tried view mobi file with okular on Linux Mint 14 Xfce.
But its KDE mobi plugin "kdegraphics-mobipocket" doesn't work.

Updated in 2016.2.5:
Okular supports j/k to move page.
Toggle any UI components in [main menu -> Settings].
