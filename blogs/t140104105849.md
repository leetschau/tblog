# Some Notetaking Softwares
Tags: linux;notetaking

Today I install Springseed and NixNote on the black laptop (Linux MInt Cinnamon 15) and try them. 
 

# Springseed

 

 The sparkling features include: 
 

* It's open source;

 

 * Synchronize with Dropbox; 

 

 * Supporting markdown syntax, and distinguishes "Save" and "edit" statuses. So It can preview the note. 

 

 * Cool interface; 

 

 But it's a GUI style app without keyboard shortcuts. 

 

# NixNote

 

 NixNote is an open source Evernote client on Linux. It is more GUI style than Evernote Windows client. For example, it doesnot support ESC to close note window. It can be closed to system tray but you have to open it with mouse. Its interface is a little better than Evernote Windows client in wine. 

 

 These 2 app are all not the ideal solutions. I will keep on develop pynote. 

  

 # Everpad 

  

 It works on Mint Cinnamon 15. But it has no search function, and its synchronization is very slow (1 hour for 1000 notes).
