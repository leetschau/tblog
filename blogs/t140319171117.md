# Text Expansion in Vim
Tags: vim; text expansion

# Vim

You have 2 options: imap and abbr.
Use "pt" for abbreviation of "Puppet" for example, first open your vim or gVim:

* imap: ":imap pt Puppet";

* abbr: ":ab pt Puppet";

The difference is, imap will expand text right after you press "t",
while for abbr, you have to type a space or tab or enter after the "t" to perform text expansion.
So when writing English, use "abbr" for it's the "normal" way.
If you write Chinese with English, imap is the better way,
because there is probably no space after the expanded words.

# Autokey

You can define 'Phrase' in Autokey.
For example, when I want to input `$TODO$`,
I can define a keyboard shortcut `fml`.
So every time when I input `fml` and a space (as an expansion trigger),
it will be expand automatically.
