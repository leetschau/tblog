# Use Lubuntu Desktop on Ubuntu 12.04

See [Ubuntu 12.04 - How to install the Lubuntu Desktop](http://complete-concrete-concise.com/ubuntu-2/ubuntu-12-04/ubuntu-12-04-how-to-install-the-lubuntu-desktop).

Lubuntu desktop responds much faster than Ubuntu Unity,
but it has no keyboard shortcut definition.

You have to edit ~/.config/openbox/lubuntu-rc.xml.
Maybe you can use autokey, but it's really slow in my test.
