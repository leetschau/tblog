# Compile and Install Python 3.5 on CentOS 6.8
Tags: python; centos; compile

------

The default Python version is 2.6 on CentOS 6.8, which is toooo out-dated.
Now compile and install Python 3.5:
```
cd /opt
mkdir python35
curl -O https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.0/Python-3.5.0.tgz
tar xf Python-3.5.0.tgz
cd Python-3.5.0
./configure --prefix=/opt/python35
make
make install
```

The key is using `--prefix` when `./configure` to specify where to install.
However, if you have no plan to remove Python 3 in the future,
it's unnecessary to add `--prefix` option when running `./configure`.
Because Python executable will be installed as `python3.5` and `python3`,
which doesn't conflict with the default Python.

Note:

If there are errors during the compile process,
try the following codes:
```
sudo yum install yum-utils
sudo yum-builddep python
```

See [How to install Python3 on CentOS](http://ask.xmodulo.com/install-python3-centos.html)
for details.
