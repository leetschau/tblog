# Resolving merge conflicts in Git
Tags: git; merge; conflict

------

Edit the conflicted files manually.
Remove "<<<<<<<", "=======" and ">>>>>>>",
then add and commit the modified files to resolve the conflict.

When using git-flow, if a conflict appears when finishing a release,
after resolve and commit the conflicted files,
run `git flow release finish 0.2.0` again.
