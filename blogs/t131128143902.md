# Rsync Omit "core" Folder

# Problem Description

Test script:

    mkdir {gsp,dst,dst2,dst3} 
    svn co http://10.0.2.59:8118/svn/gsp/Development-Area/3-SCL/Trunk/TaskServer_Gsp gsp
    rsync -auC gsp/* dst/
    rsync -au gsp/* dst2/
    rsync -auC --include=core gsp/ dst3/
    rsync -au gsp/ dst4/
    diff -rq gsp dst

Output:

Only in gsp/com.boco.gdpp.taskserver.core/src/com/boco/gdpp/taskserver: core

# Cause and Solution

The -C option looks "core" as a *source version control* folder, and exclude it. See man page for details.

The size of the ".svn" folder is similar to the host folder. So "-C" option is necessary. Becase ".svn" is not "*", so there is no ".svn" in dst2. But it will also exclude other ".*" folder in gsp. So the right answer is:

    rsync -auC --include=core gsp/ dst3/

The dst4 is a completely copy.
