# Server side

Use netcat on Linux as server: `nc -lkC 192.168.71.102 5555`.

Here `-l` means *listen*; `-k` means *not close when client closed*.
`-C` means *Send CRLF as line-ending*, which is very useful when connect with `telnet` from Windows.
If the client is netcat, `-C` is unnecessary.

# Client side

## Use MobaXterm netcat

Run `nc 192.168.71.102 5555` in MobaXterm. Press `Ctrl-c` to quit connection session.

## Use telnet on Windows

`telnet 192.168.71.102 5555`.
Open local echo: press `Ctrl+]` to open telnet prompt,
then input `set localecho` and press `<Enter>` only to leave telnet prompt environment.
Press `q` in telnet prompt environment to quit telnet session.
