# A Good Tutorial about C++ Syntax and Points
Tags: C++; pointer

------

The whole tutorial [C++ Language](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/) is concise and helpful. The section [Pointers](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/pointers/) is a good introduction of pointers. It distinguishes many myth of pointers, for example:

* It distinguishes "pointer declaration" of "dereference operation". They use both the same operator "*", but are different things.

* Pointer and array are largely the same, but an import difference: pointer can be reassigned, while array variable can't.

* Incrementation of a pointer produce different result regarding to the data type it referenced. Say a pointer p has the address 1000, according to its referenced type, the incrementation results are:

    char * p; p = 1000; p++ is 1001;
    short * p; p = 1000; p++ is 1002;
    long * p; p = 1000; p++ is 1004;
