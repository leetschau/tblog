# Code Quality Check based on Jenkins and Sonar
Tags: sonar;jenkins;ubuntu

------

Based on Jenkins 1.5 with Sonar plugins, Ubuntu 12.04.

# Installation and System Configuration

* Install and config Jenkins: see note " Install Jenkins and plugins by hand ";

* Install and config Sonar and Sonar Runner: see note " Analyze Java Code with Sonar on Ubuntu ";

## Jenkins System Configuration

Manage Jenkins -> Configure System:

    Sonar Runner: Name: MySonarRunner; SONAR_RUNNER_HOME: parent folder of "bin/sonar-runner" script;
    Sonar -> Sonar Installations -> Advanced:
    Name: MySonar;
    Sonar account login/password: admin/admin;
    Server URL: leave blank(http://localhost:9000, if sonar server is not at the same server with jenkins, notice no "/" at the end of this url);
    Database URL: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/sonar?useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=utf8&rewriteBatchedStatements=true(equals to "sonar.jdbc.url" in $SONAR_SERVER/conf/sonar.properties, notice "localhost" can not be writen as ip address);
    Database login/password: sonar/sonar;
    Database Driver: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver;

# Project-specific Sonar Runner Configuration

Creating file /opt/sonar-server/gcp.properties as followings: see note " Analyze Java Code with Sonar on Ubuntu " and notice:

    sonar.sources=src (a relative path name whose root directory is $PROJECT_WORKSPACE);
    sonar.sourceEncoding=GBK (determined by source file encoding, default is UTF-8);

# Jenkins Project Configuration

Source Code Management: Subversion -> enter subversion url;

Build: 

    Execute Shell: cp /opt/sonar-server/gcp.properties ./sonar-project.properties
    Invoke Standalone Sonar Analysis

Do not add post-build actions "Sonar" because it's bounded with Maven. If there is no pom.xml at the root of the project, an error raises.
