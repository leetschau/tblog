# Start Jenkins Server with Specified Home Directory
Tags: environment variables;jenkins

------

You can get the current home directory of a Jenkins server at "Manage Jenkins -> Configure System -> Home Directory".

When starting a Jenkins server, you can specify its home directory through setting environment variable JENKINS_HOME:

    export JENKINS_HOME=~/.jenkins

then 

    java -jar <jenkins-ver.war> --httpPort=8088

or start as a daemon service:

    nohup java -jar <jenkins-ver.war> --httpPort=8088 1>jenkins.log 2>jenkins.log &

When update Jenkins or install some new plugins, you may find all jobs gone. Don't be panic, it's probably because the home folder are changed (for example, ~/.hudson) by the plugins. Specify home directory as above, all jobs will come back.
