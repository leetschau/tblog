Tags: session; tabs; browser

------

Session is a group of tabs, which is relevant to a specific problem,
for example: how to use ElasticSearch with MongoDB,
or background information about TV show "The Wire".

# Firefox

Save: right click on the tab bar and select "Bookmark All Tabs" (Shift + Ctrl + D);

Restore: click "Show your bookmarks" button on toolbar,
navigate to the folder and click "Open all Tabs" at the bottom.

# Chrome

Install extension "Session Buddy".
It will help you to save and restore all open tabs as a "Session".

To sync sessions between browsers of different hosts,
use "Settings -> Export" to save the session into a json file,
copy this file to the target host,
use "Settings -> Import" to import the session.
