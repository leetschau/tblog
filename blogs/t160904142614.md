# Execute sudo without password
Tags: linux; sudo; password

------

Tom (username: tom) want to execute sudo command without input password.
For example: `sudo cat /etc/sudoers`.

Append `tom  ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL` to /etc/sudoers.

Logout (the desktop if you are in the desktop environment) and login 
to make the rule works.

If the tmux server is created before the modification of the sudoers files,
quit the tmux server (which means quit all it's sessions) and the new rule
will works in the new session.

# Note

Q: Why not add this line right after `root    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL`?

A: Because in this way the rule `tom ...` will be **overwritten** by
the rule below ():

    %sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

This rule make all users in sudo group run sudo command with password.
When tom is a member of group 'sudo',
he will have to input password when sudo a command.
You can remove tom from 'sudo' group to make things work.
But this is not as elegant as put `tom All...` at the bottom of the file.

Q: Why does rule of tom overwritten by rule of sudo group?

A: Because `/etc/sudoers` is a script, a posterior command overwrites
preceding commands.
