# Fix Jenkins Startup and Access Failure on CentOS
Tags: Jenkins; Network; iptables

------

Today I install Jenkins on CentOS 6. When start the service with "java -jar jenkins.war --httpPort=8088", it raised a "java.net.unknownhostexception: Temporary failure in name resolution" error.

Resolution: add hostname ("tybvt" here) into "127.0.0.1" name of /etc/hosts, from:

    127.0.0.1  localhost.localdomain localhost

to:

    127.0.0.1  tybvt localhost.localdomain localhost

When Jenkins start successfully, only can access from "localhost:8088", "10.0.2.47:8088" is rejected. It's because the firewall "iptables" service. So we need to add a rule into iptables configuration. Add:

    -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 8088 -j ACCEPT

**right after** the line "-A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT" in file /etc/sysconfig/iptables.
Or simply stop the service with "service iptables stop" if security is not a concern.
