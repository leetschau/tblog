# Get Total Testcase Number in JUnit Report File with grep and awk
Tags: shell;awk;grep

------

Under $JENKINS_HOME/jobs/GSP/workspace/build/work/plugins(we call this folder as "basedir"), there are many bundle folders. Some of them were compiled, so there are many test report file "TEST-<full-name>.xml" in <bundle-name>/build/unittest_report, for example, com.boco.gsp.element.decision.config/build/unittest_report/TEST-com.boco.gsp.decision.config.parser.DecisionParserTest.xml. The content of this file is:

 

 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>

 <testsuite errors="0" failures="0" hostname=" 
pwm" name="com.boco.gsp.decision.config.parser.DecisionParserTest" tests="3" time="0.127" timestamp="2013-12-05T19:25:11">

  <properties>

   ...

 </testsuite>

 

In this case the testcase number is 3 according to 'test="3"'. Now we need get the total number of testcases with following steps:

 

 1. find all these test report file under ${basedir};

 

 1. get the testcase number;

 

 1. add all these number up;

 

 1. print the result;

 

We achieve this by the following command under ${basedir}:

 

 grep -Po '(?<=tests=")\d+' **/TEST-*.xml | awk -F':' '{SUM += $2; print $1 ": " $2} END {print "Total: " SUM}'

 

"-P" let grep interpret pattern as perl regular expression. "-o" means only output the matched part. "(?>=...)" eliminates the text in parenthesis. "-F" of awk specify the delimiter. This command works on zsh because the "**/*" syntax only valid on zsh. If you use bash, you have to modify this.
