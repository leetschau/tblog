# Environment Variables of Ubuntu GUI Applications
Tags: environment variables;ubuntu

------

In Ubuntu Desktop you have to modify /etc/environment and ${HOME}/.pam_environment instead of /etc/bash.bashrc and ${HOME}/.bashrc to set environment variables. See [EnvironmentVariables](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnvironmentVariables) for details.

 

${HOME}/.pam_environment does not worked, don't know why.
