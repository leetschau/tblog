# Fix GUI App Start Failure With No Display Found

When running `gitg` in Ubuntu terminal, I got errors below:

> ** (gitg:29283): WARNING **: Could not open X display
> 
> (gitg:29283): Gtk-WARNING **: cannot open display: localhost:10.0

Solution: check you $DISPLAY value, if it's not ":0.0",
run `export DISPLAY=:0.0`.

To test keycode of the same key in different OS,
I ssh to my Linux laptop with Kitty on Windows.
When I run `xev`, I got an error:
`xev: unable to open display ''`.

# Open GUI of Remote Server on Client's Screen

I ssh to a my Ubuntu laptop with `ssh -X -v user@192.168.1.4` or
`ssh -Y -v user@192.168.1.4` and run `DISPLAY=:0.0 gedit`,
the gedit window opens on the screen of the laptop.

The reason is in the output of `who`:
```
$ who
leo      :0           2018-01-15 07:19 (:0)
leo      pts/8        2018-01-15 07:20 (:0)
leo      pts/1        2018-01-15 07:53 (192.168.1.14)
```

You can see the display `(:0)` attached to `pts/8`.
While there's no display attached to the remotely connected client `pts/1`.

There's an environment variable `XAUTHORITY` to be set as well.
