* [Feature selection](https://www.packtpub.com/mapt/book/big_data_and_business_intelligence/9781788297752/9/ch09lvl1sec44/feature-selection) of book *Ensemble Machine Learning* by Ankit Dixit: the workflow chart is excellent.

# Implementation

## Recursive feature elimination with cross-validation

[Recursive feature elimination with cross-validation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/feature_selection/plot_rfe_with_cross_validation.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-feature-selection-plot-rfe-with-cross-validation-py)

Keywords: Python, RFECV

## Extracting Features with Transformers

Keywords: Python, `SelectKBest`, `chi2`

Data source: [Adult](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult)

Chapter 5 of "Learning Data Mining with Python" by Robert Layton
```
X = adult[["Age", "Education-Num", "Capital-gain", "Capital-loss", "Hours-per-week"]].values
y = (adult["Earnings-Raw"] == ' >50K').values

from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest
from sklearn.feature_selection import chi2
transformer = SelectKBest(score_func=chi2, k=3)
Xt_chi2 = transformer.fit_transform(X, y)

from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.cross_validation import cross_val_score
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=14)
scores_chi2 = cross_val_score(clf, Xt_chi2, y, scoring='accuracy')
print("Chi2 performance: {0:.3f}".format(scores_chi2.mean()))
```

## Feature selection for machine learning

[Feature selection for machine learning](https://www.packtpub.com/mapt/book/big_data_and_business_intelligence/9781788297752/9/ch09lvl1sec45/feature-selection-for-machine-learning) of  book *Ensemble Machine Learning*.

Keywords: Python

Data source: Pima Indians Diabetes dataset

Note: [Feature Selection For Machine Learning in Python](https://machinelearningmastery.com/feature-selection-machine-learning-python/) is almost the same with this chapter.
