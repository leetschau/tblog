# Unicode and File I/O in Python 2.X and 3.X
Tags: Unicode; Python; File

------

In Python 2.x, the default string is byte string, which means every byte is convert to a character.
If you write a Unicode string, you have to write it as u'...'.
On the contrary, in Python 3.x, the default string is Unicode string.
If you want a byte string, you have to write it as b'...'.

In Python 3.3:

    chn = '将帖子翻译为中\n'
    with open('py3uni', 'w') as f:
        f.write(chn)
    print(chn.encode('utf-8'))
    mygbk = chn.encode('gbk')
    with open('py3gbk', 'wb') as f:
      f.write(mygbk)
    readgbk = open('py3gbk', encoding='gbk').read()
    print(readgbk)
    print(type(readgbk))  # <class 'str'>

In Python 2.7:

    # -*- encoding: utf-8 -*-
    import codecs
    inputStr = u'将帖子翻译为中文2015年3月\n'

    gbkFn = 'gbkFile'
    utf8Fn = 'utf8File'
    print('Print original Unicdoe string: ' + inputStr)
    print('Print in UTF-8 encoding: ' + inputStr.encode('utf-8'))
    with codecs.open(utf8Fn, 'w', 'utf-8') as f:
        f.write(inputStr)
    fromUTF8 = codecs.open(utf8Fn, encoding='utf-8').read()
    with codecs.open(gbkFn, 'w', 'gbk') as f:
        f.write(inputStr)
    fromGBK = codecs.open(gbkFn, encoding='gbk').read()
    print('Strings from different encodings are the same?')
    print(fromUTF8 == fromGBK)
    print("\nString type:")
    print(type(fromGBK))

You can convert gbkFile to utf8File in shell with:
`iconv -f gbk -t utf8 gbkFile > utf8File`.

You can also write strings to file in this way:

    gbkStr = inputStr.encode('gbk')
    with open('gbkFile', 'wb') as f:
        f.write(gbkStr)

While it's not as concise as the previous method.
