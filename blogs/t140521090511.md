# Convert MS Visual Studio C++ Project to makefile
Tags: convert; visual studio; makefile; c++

This morning I converted a Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 C++ solution to a Linux makefile with [MakeItSo](http://code.google.com/p/make-it-so/). The process:

1. On a Windows host with VS2008 installed, download MakeItSo_1.2.2.zip from its website, unzip it;

1. In the unzipped folder, run `MakeItSo.exe -file=c:\docs\myproject\myproj.sln`;

1. In the root folder of the solution, a Makefile is generated. A <project-name>.makefile is generated at each project folder (where the .vcproj file resides).

1. Copy the solution folder to a Linux host with "make" installed (verified with `make --version`), run `make` to build the whole solution or `make <project-name>` to build a specific project.

That's it.

Note: Another coverting tool [sln2mak](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/28908/Tool-for-Converting-VC-Project-to-Linux-Makef) is also tried this morning, but failed.
