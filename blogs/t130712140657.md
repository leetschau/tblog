# ranger

vi style console file manager.
Use `rifle` as the file launcher.
Use `?` to see manpage, `1?` to list key shortcuts.

Set 'show hidden files' as default:
`echo 'set show_hidden true' >> $HOME/.config/ranger/rc.conf`.

ranger's bookmark function is powerful and convenient.
Mark a folder with `mX`, jump to this bookmark with `'X`.
After the single quote key is pressed, all defined bookmarks will be listed.

## FUS

`h/l`: go to the parent/child folder;
`H/L`: go back/forward through navigation history;
`gh`: jump to $HOME;
`C-h`: show/hide hidden files;

`i`: preview file in a larger window, `q` to quit to ranger;
`I`: rename file;
`E`: edit file (with vim);
`<delete>` or `:delete`: delete file;
`dd`: cut file/folder;
`pp`: paste file/folder;

`S`: open a new shell, `Ctrl-d` to exit and back to ranger;
