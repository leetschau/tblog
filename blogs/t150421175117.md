# Checkout Remote Git Branch
Tags: git; branch

------

We clone a remote repository, check out a remote branch.

    $ git clone https://github.com/limingth/meteor-master-classes.git
    $ cd meteor-master-classes
    $ git branch -r
    origin/HEAD -> origin/master
    origin/fanjinhui
    origin/lichao
    origin/limingth
    origin/master
    origin/sean
    origin/tianchao

So the remote repository's name is "origin".
First check the initial status of the repository:

    $ git branch
    * master

    $ git remote show origin
    * remote origin
      Fetch URL: https://github.com/limingth/meteor-master-classes.git
      Push  URL: https://github.com/limingth/meteor-master-classes.git
      HEAD branch: master
      Remote branches:
        fanjinhui tracked
        lichao    tracked
        limingth  tracked
        master    tracked
        sean      tracked
        tianchao  tracked
      Local branch configured for 'git pull':
        master merges with remote master
      Local ref configured for 'git push':
        master pushes to master (up to date)

Now checkout the remote branch:

    $ git fetch
    $ git checkout lichao

Check the status of the repository after checked out:

    $ git br
    * lichao     <---
      master

    $ git remote show origin
    * remote origin
      Fetch URL: https://github.com/limingth/meteor-master-classes.git
      Push  URL: https://github.com/limingth/meteor-master-classes.git
      HEAD branch: master
      Remote branches:
        fanjinhui tracked
        lichao    tracked
        limingth  tracked
        master    tracked
        sean      tracked
        tianchao  tracked
      Local branches configured for 'git pull':
        lichao merges with remote lichao        <---
        master merges with remote master
      Local refs configured for 'git push':
        lichao pushes to lichao (up to date)    <---
        master pushes to master (up to date)

You can see there are 2 kinds of relationship between local and remote branches: pull and push.
Branch "lichao" and "origin/lichao" was linked bidirectional after checked out.

Some notes:

* The name of the remote branch to be checked out is its full name except the "origin/" part,
  like "lichao" in `git checkout lichao`;

* `git fetch` synchronize your local repository with remote side.
  So it's not necessary if you don't want sync with remote.

You can verify this by `git branch -avv`.
