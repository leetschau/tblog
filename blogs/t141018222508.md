# ArchLinux Sound Control on Thinkpad T440p
Tags: sound; archlinux

$ sudo pacman -S alsa-utils
$ alsamixer
The "Card" value on the left-upper corner is "HDA Intel HDMI". This is not right.
Press F6, a list appear:
-   (default)
0   HDA Intel HDMI
1   HDA Intel PCH
29  ThinkPad Console Audio Control

This means there are totally 3 playback devices. And currently "0 HDA Intel HDMI" is the default one.
However this is a wrong one. The right audio output device should have "dB gain..." in its "Item" value.
If we choose "1 HDA Intel PCH", on the upper-left corner there will be a line: "Item: Master [dB gain: 0.00]".
So this is the right one, and its id is "1".

In window of this device, tab to "Master", use "m" key to toogle its status from "MM" (means mute) to "OO" (means open this device).
Then use up arrow key to increase its volume, until the "dB gain" is zero.

Quit it with "ESC" key. Create a new file ~/.asoundrc:

    defaults.ctl.card 1
    defaults.pcm.card 1

Now test it with `speaker-test -c 2`.
