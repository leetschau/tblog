# i3 Window Manager on ArchLinux
Tags: i3wm; archlinux

------

i3 is a good wm(window manager), it's powerful and easy to install. It supports system tray, app like golden-dict will have a icon in system tray after it's closed.

# Install

    # pacman -S xorg-server xorg-server-utils
    # pacman -S xorg-xinit
    # pacman -S dmenu
    # pacman -Syu gnome    // use `pacman -Rsc gnome` to remove package and its dependencies
    # pacman -S i3
    $ echo "exec i3" >  ~/.xinitrc
    $ startx

# Configuration

Config file: ~/.i3/config.

Define Alt key:

    set $mod Mod4

Define Win key:

    set $sup Mod1

Adjust the font of titlebar:

    font pango:Dejavu Sans Mono 11

Add custom keybindings:

    bindsym $sup+x exec /home/chad/apps/idea-IC-135.690/bin/idea.sh

# Application Autostart

Add start command **before** "exec i3" in ~/.xinitrc.
For example, the following lines in ~/.xinitrc start USB stisk, clipboard and Chinese input method manager when i3wm startup:

    fcitx &
    parcellite &
    udiskie &
    xbindkeys
    exec i3

# Search Application

You can use dmenu as xfce4-appfinder on Xfce.
For example, after install R-Studio-Desktop with `yaourt -S rstudio-desktop-bin`,
input 'studio' in dmenu (press Alt-D to invoke it),
you can find the full name of RStudio Desktop is "rstudio-bin".

# Applications

## Terminal and File Manager

Xfce family is small and powerful. Install them with `pacman -S xfce4-terminal` and `pacman -S thunar`.
xfce4-terminal is much better for eyes than Terminator.

## Web Browser

Install Chromium with `sudo pacman -S chromium`.
Install flash plugin for Chromium with `yaourt -S chromium-pepper-flash`.
Now you can use website which need flash support, such as [Baidu Netdisk](http://pan.baidu.com/).

## Text Editor

Clipboard-support enabled vim: gvim;

## PDF Viewer

Evince is small and poweroff. Install it with `sudo pacman -S evince`.

## Office Suite

[WPS](http://www.wps.cn/) is OK, but the fcitx doesn't work in it.

Installed [FreeOffice](http://www.freeoffice.com/), it need providing Email to activate, give up.

fcitx can be used in Abiword. But Abiword is only a word processor, no spred sheets support.

# Wireless Card

1. Install wifi utilities: `pacman -S iw wpa_supplicant dialog wpa_actiond`;

1. List wireless card status: `iwconfig`;

1. Scan and Connect to hot point: `sudo wifi-menu`

1. Remember this hot point for auto-connection later (modify the wireless name based on your machine): `systemctl enable netctl-auto@wlp5s0.service`;

# Status Bar Customization

For i3status, use `man i3status` to determine the configuration file position, here it's ~/.config/i3status/config.
Then `cp /etc/i3status.conf ~/.i3status.conf` as template. Modify the ethernet and wireless card name in **both** "order += ..." and function definition line.

# Frequently used keybindings

"M" means $mod key, "S" means Shift key.

* M-d: application launcher;

* M-<Enter>: start a termianl;

* M-f: full screen current app;

* M-S-q: quit

* M-S-c: reload config without restart;

* M-2: jump to workspace 2;

* M-S-2: move application to workspace 2;

# USB Automount & Unmount

See note "Automount USB Disk on Linux".

# Power Management

First install polkit with `sudo pacman -S polkit`, which enable normal users run power management command without root privilege (sudo).
Then add a executable script into /usr/local/bin:

    cat /usr/local/bin/pm
    #!/bin/sh
    lock() {
        i3lock
    }

    case "$1" in
        lock)
            lock
            ;;
        logout)
            i3-msg exit
            ;;
        suspend)
            lock && systemctl suspend
            ;;
        hibernate)
            lock && systemctl hibernate
            ;;
        reboot)
            systemctl reboot
            ;;
        shutdown)
            systemctl poweroff
            ;;
        *)
            echo "Usage: $0 {lock|logout|suspend|hibernate|reboot|shutdown}"
            exit 2
    esac

    exit 0
    $ sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/pm

Now using `pm suspend` to suspend, `pm reboot` to reboot, and `pm shutdown` to shutdown computer.
