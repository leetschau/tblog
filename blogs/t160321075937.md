# Toggle Syntastic Mode to Speedup Vim
Tags: vim; syntastic

------

Sometimes syntastic's syntax checker make vim slow down.
To speed it up, add `cabbrev stm SyntasticToggleMode<CR>` into .vimrc.

When syntax checker annoying, use `:stm` to shut it down.
And do it again to open it again.

BTW: use `:ab` to list all abbreviations defined in .vimrc.
