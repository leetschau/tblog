# Disable Nautilus Desktop
Tags: nautilus; desktop; wallpaper

------

In i3wm, start nautilus will show a desktop, which is useless.
To prevent this desktop showing when starting nautilus,
run `gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background show-desktop-icons false`.
To enable it again, run
`gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background show-desktop-icons true`

Turning off desktop will make wallpapaer disappear,
which makes the desktop looks bad in Unity environment.
