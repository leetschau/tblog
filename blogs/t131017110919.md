# Access, Modify, Change Time of Linux File
Tags: linux;time

------

All these 3 time can be viewed by "stat <file>" command.
 
 Access time is influenced by read operation, such as command cat, more, less, head, tail, grep, sed, etc. This time is queried by "find . -atime -1", and can be set by "touch -a" command;
 
 Change time is the time when inode is changed, which influenced by command mv, chmod, chown, etc;
 
 Modification time is the time the **content** of the file changed, and be listed by "ls -l" command. It's influenced by command vi, etc, and can be set by "touch -m" command;
 
 "touch -t" set access and modification time to the specified time;
 
 Creation time is not saved. So it's impossible to query files according to creation time;
