# Multiple Cursors in Vim
Tags: multiple; cursor; vim; plugin

------

Use plugin [vim-multiple-cursors](https://github.com/terryma/vim-multiple-cursors).

Install this plugin with adding `Plugin 'terryma/vim-multiple-cursors'`
into .vimrc.

The default key mappings is C-n for start multiple cursors and move to next,
C-p for previous, C-x to skip, and <ECS> for quit.
For C-n conflicts with nerdtree, modify the nerdtree trigger to `C-i`:
```
nnoremap <C-i> :NERDTreeTabsToggle<CR>
```

Note:

Do **not** map 'next/previous' to C-j/k as follows:

```
" multiple cursors configs
let g:multi_cursor_next_key='<C-j>'
let g:multi_cursor_prev_key='<C-k>'
```

for C-j/k is mapped to keys jumping between windows.
