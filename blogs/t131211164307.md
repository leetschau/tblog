# Jump between vim and shell

 

You have 2 options to working on shell without leaving vi:

 

1. ":sh" + "C-d": you don't know if you are in a "real" shell;

 

1. "C-z" + "fg": you can check if you've suspended a vim with "jobs", recommended;


 

# Insert outside text into vim buffer

 

* from another file: ":r <file_name>";

 

* from external command: ":r !<command>", for example:

 

 :r !ls -l|grep abc
