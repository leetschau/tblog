Tags: subversion; dump; import; export

# Overall steps

1. Get dump file from FTP:

1. Build repository based on the dump file;

1. Authorize user of this repository.

# Operation details

## On Windows

    # get dump file with TotalCmd;
    cd K:\svn
    svnadmin create ALARM
    svnadmin load ALARM < f:\tmp\ALARM-dumpfile
    # add the following text into file "c:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache2\svnaccessfile"
        ALARM-dev=user1,user2,user3
        ####
        [ALARM:/Development-Area]
        @ALARM-dev = rw
        @QA = rw
        @Manager = r
        bvt_common = r
        * = 
        [ALARM:/Management-Area]
        @ALARM-dev = rw
        @QA = rw
        @Manager = r
        * = 
        [ALARM:/Release-Area]
        @ALARM-dev = rw
        @Manager = r
        @QA = rw
        test = r
        * = 
        [ALARM:/Test-Area]
        @ALARM-dev = r
        @QA = rw
        @Manager = r
        * = 
    # add following text into file "c:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache2\passwd"
        user1:pwd1
        user2:pwd2
        user3:pwd3

## On Linux

    ftp 123.xxx.xxx.xxx
    > get ALARM-dumpfile
    > bye
    cd $SVN_REPO_HOME
    svnadmin create ALARM
    svnadmin load ALARM < ~\ALARM-dumpfile
    # edit file svnaccessfile & passwd the same way with in Windows

Note:

The default auth rule is "everyone can access everything" like the following text in svnaccessfile:

    [/] 
    * = r
    @Manager = rw
    @QA = rw
    @Dev = rw
    @TEST-all = rw

then define more detailed rules to override the default one, notice the last line:

    [ALARM:/Development-Area]
    @ALARM-dev = rw
    ...
    * = 

But we can define auth rules in another way:

    [/]
    * =
    [ALARM:/Development-Area]
    @ALARM-dev = rw
    ...
