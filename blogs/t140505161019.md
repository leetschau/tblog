# RRM-based Linux

On rpm-based Linux, runlevel 3 means text mode, 5 means X desktop mode. So if you want only start OS without desktop environment, modify runlevel from 5 to 3.

You can do this as root with command: `init 3`, or modify /etc/inittab file and reboot:

from:

    id:5:initdefault:

to:

    id:3:initdefault:

Need verified.

# Linux Mint

Open file /boot/grub/grub.cfg, in section "### BEGIN /etc/grub.d/10_linux ###", and then "menuentry ...",
there's a command "linux /boot/vmlinuz...", replace string "quiet splash" with "text",
save file and reboot.

Here "quiet", "splash" and "text" are all starting options.
If you want only display Mint splash window, without printing boot messages,
and finally start into console (not the login manager, GDM), use "quiet splash text".

Verified 2014/5/5.

Note: /etc/inittab is a config file originally used by init of Unix system V, which is deprecated by most Linux distros now.
It's replaced by upstart or systemd.
