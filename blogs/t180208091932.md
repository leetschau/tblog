* T-test: Compares the means of a variable from **two** groups.
An independent t-test compares the means of two different groups
(e.g., reaction times on a task for women vs. men),
whereas a paired t-test compares the means of the same group at two different
times (e.g., reaction times for the same people on a task before or
after a training period).

* ANOVA: Compares the means of **3 or more** groups.
Repeated-measures ANOVA is used when it is the same group of people
in each group, as in a paired t-test.

* Chi-square: Comparing **nominal** data (e.g, # of correct responses).

* Correlation: Measuring the strength of a relationship between
two **continuous** variables (e.g., height and age).

* Regression: Similar to correlation, but used to define the relationship
between two continuous variables such that you can then **make predictions**.
For example, after finding the equation that best describes
the relationship between height and age in your sample,
can then predict the height of someone of an age not in your sample.
