# Increase Disk Size of Virtualbox Machine
Tags: VirtualBox

------

1. Goto virtual disk folder and run command "VBoxManage modifyhd <your_disk>.vdi --resize new_size". Note that the parameter following "--resize" is the **total** size of the disk, not the size to be added. Its unit is MB: 
 
 ┌─[chad@chadpc527] - [~/VirtualBoxVMs/Win7Office] - [2013-07-29 03:43:11] 
 └─[0] VBoxManage modifyhd Win7Office.vdi --resize 20480 
 0%...10%...20%...30%...40%...50%...60%...70%...80%...90%...100% 

 

This command runs really fast(it finished in 3 or 4 seconds). The initial size of this disk is 10 GB. But after installation of windows 7 and office 2010, 8.7 GB was consumed. So I want enlarge the disk size to 20 GB, which is 20480 MB.

 

1. Open this virtual machine(here is a windows 7) and right click "My Computer", choose "Manage";


 

1. Click "Disk Manage" on left panel. You will notice some blank space next to your C drive (which means the space addition operation succeed);

 

1. Right click C drive in right panel and choose "Extend Volume". Follow the wizard to increase space of C drive.
