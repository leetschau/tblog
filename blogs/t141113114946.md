# Using pub of Dart with Jayproxy
Tags: jayproxy; pub; dart

------

Dart's pub tool is blocked by GFW. So we have to use it with the help of a proxy.

Modify pubspec.yaml at the root of a Dart project. Then run the following commands at this position:

    export http_proxy=http://<username>:<password>@us.jayproxy.net:6000
    export https_proxy=http://<username>:<password>@us.jayproxy.net:6000
    pub get
