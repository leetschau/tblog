# Create Executable Links in Linux
Tags: linux

------

For example, as a common user we want to use application "pandoc" installed by root. We can achieve this by copy a soft link to /usr/bin.

    # cd /usr/bin
    # ln -s ~/.cabal/bin/pandoc

Now we can use "pandoc". If it complains "Permission Denied", use it with "sudo".
