# Add executables to dmenu path

We add executables to dmenu path via adding a soft link into /usr/local/bin, which is a dmenu search path.

You can use absolute path: `sudo ln -s $HOME/apps/eclipse-java-luna-R-x86_64/eclipse /usr/local/bin/eclipse`.

If you're already in the executable's folder, create links via `realpath`: `sudo ln -s $(realpath DartEditor) /usr/local/bin/dartEditor`.
