# How to Sync a Fork on Github
Tags: sync; github

I forked [flask repository](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask) to
[my own account](https://github.com/leetschau/flask).

After several months, there are many new commits to the original flask repo.
How to sync these new commits to my fork?

# Option 1: In Github Web UI

Three steps: compare, send pull request, and merge.

See Olufemi Israel Olanipeku's answer of
[How can I keep my fork in sync without adding a separate remote?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20984802/how-can-i-keep-my-fork-in-sync-without-adding-a-separate-remote/21131381#21131381) for details.

# Option 2: In Terminal

You can do it via your local clone:

1. Clone leetschau/flask to local machine;

1. Add mitsuhiko/flask as a remote repo;

1. Pull new commit from mitsuhiko/flask to your local machine;

1. Push your local repo to leetschau/flask.

See [Syncing a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) for details.
