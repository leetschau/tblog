# Chinese Characters Can't Be Displayed Correctly in git log
Tags: git; Chinese; unicode

------

On Ubuntu 14.04, `cat` can display Chinese characters correctly.
But in `vi` and `less` Chinese characters can't display correctly.

Solution:

Run `export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8` before `git log`.

If it works, add this line into /etc/environment.

If it doesn't work, run `export LANG=en_US.UTF-8`.

If it doesn't work, run `apt-get install language-pack-en-base`.

In vim, run `set enc=utf-8`.
