# Xfce is a Good Desktop Choice
Tags: Xfce;linux;Mint

------

Try out Mint Xfce(linuxmint-14-xfce-dvd-32bit.iso) in Virtual Box this morning. It's fast(duo to Xfce), beautiful and customizable(convenient than LXDE's openbox). I installed Terminator and erlang from its "Software Manager", and shell command "tree" from apt-get smoothly. Application Finder(Alt + F3) and 

Window Manager are also helpful and powerful. Some frequently used shortcuts including(all defined in Window Manager -> Keyboard):

* Show Desktop: Alt + Ctrl + z (the defaut A-C-d is unconvenient);

* Minimize Window: Alt + F9;

* Maximize/Restore Window: Alt+F10;

* Go to workspace 1/2/3/4: Ctrl + F1/F2/F3/F4;

I defined a shortcut(Alt + T) for Terminator in Application Finder -> keyboard -> Application Shortcuts.

# Customize Desktop

right click on panel -> Panel -> Panel Preferences:

* make panel vertical: Display -> Mode: Vertical;

* remove time, date and "Menu" from panel: Items: select time and date item and click remove button on the right side;

* add desktop clock: see note " Use Conky as Desktop Clock on Xfce ";

* only display window icon (no title) on panel: Item -> Window Buttons -> Edit -> Uncheck "Show button labels";

* make panel semi-transparent: Appearance: Background -> Style: Background Image; Opacity -> Enter: 100, Leave: 50; (you have to use "AppFinder -> Window Manager Tweaks -> Compositor: Enable display compositing" to make Opacity value adjustable. You can also make window semi-transparent when moving by setting "Opacity of windows during move", which is a sub-option of "Enable display compositing"); 

* Get desktop resolution: ~/.config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/displays.xml:

    <property name="Resolution" type="string" value="1366x768"/>
