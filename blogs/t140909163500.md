# Package Repository Management on Ubuntu and Mint
Tags: package; repository; ubuntu; mint

------

* Add repository: 'sudo apt-add-repository ppa:kernel-ppa/ppa`

* List all repositories: `ls /etc/apt/sources.list.d`

* Remove repository: `sudo apt-add-repository --remove ppa:kernel-ppa/ppa`.
If you can't get the PPA name, do it manually with `sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/theppa.list`.

For desktop version, say Ubuntu 14.04 Unity,
you can also manage PPAs in GUI:

System Settings -> Software & Updates -> Other Software

You can see all PPAs are listed here.
When an item is unchecked, say "http://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu",
under the hood the line "deb http://..."
in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-3.0.list is commented out.
