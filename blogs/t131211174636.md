# TCO in Python

TCO (Tail Recursion Optimization) will probably never be supported by CPython
because Guido believe TCO will make debugging difficult by messing up tracebacks.

Try the following scripts:

    cnt = 1000
 
    def trisum(n, csum): 
      if n == 0: 
        return csum 
      else: 
        return trisum(n-1, csum+n) 
    print trisum(cnt,0) 

It runs OK when cnt is 10 or 100, but when it's 1000 a runtime error raised:
"RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded".

You can always use iteration to replace recursion like that in the following
reference, but that is not FP.
