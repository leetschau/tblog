# Lookup Service Provider by IP Address
Tags: IP Address; dig

------

Now we have a ip address and a user account, we want to know its service provider. Let's find the truth step by step.

1. It's a virtual machine or not?

Login to this server using the user account and run:

    $ cat /proc/cpuinfo

At the "model name" line, I found "QEMU Virtual CPU version 1.0". So it's a virtual machine and probably a VPS (virtual private server). I need verify my guess.

1. What is its service provider?

On my laptop, run command:

    $ dig -x <ipaddress>

In the "AUTHORITY SECTION", I found "nsl.digitalocean.com". Google "digitalocean.com" shows it's a VPS provider.

1. Which solution this VPS uses?

On https://www.digitalocean.com/ I found a solution $5/month, with 512MB ram. To verify, on VPS run:

    $ free -m

It shows the total memory is 490MB. That's it.
