# Meld (GUI App)

TotalCommander's Mint(Ubuntu) counterpart is "Meld". It supports command-line
invocation, much slower than TotalCmd, and its visual filters and
backup policies are all weaker than that of TotalCmd
(See dsnote " Auto Dir Sync Script Based on Total Commander " for details).
Use it from command line: 

    meld dir1 dir2

Note: Gnome-commander is much like TotalCmd, and it can use Meld as sync tools.

# rsync

    rsync -rtvu --delete <src_folder> <dst_folder>

for example:

    rsync -rtvu --delete ~/Documents/CalibreLib/ 'chad@10.21.3.31:/home/chad/Calibre Library'

very slow. Maybe you can fast it with adding a "-c" parameter(checksum): `rsync -rtuvc ...`

In parameter list, r means recursive (including subdirs); t meas preserve modification time of the files; v means verbose; u means update, if the file in dst is newer than that in src, it will not be copied; --delete means delete files in destination folder which not exist in source folder.

Note: never forget the trailing slash of src_folder (that after dst_folder is unnecessary), or src_folder will be copied **into** the dst_folder.
