# Sync a Fork on Gibhub
Tags: sync; fork; github; repository

I've forked a github repo  "https://github.com/tom/project1.git".
Several days later there are some new commits on this repo.
How to sync these commits into my forked repo?

```
cd <repo-home>
git remote -v  # verify if the upstream repo will be added
git remote add upstream  https://github.com/tom/project1.git
git remote -v
git checkout master
git fetch upstream   # if use pull instead of fetch, merge is needed as well
git merge upstream/master
git push origin
```
