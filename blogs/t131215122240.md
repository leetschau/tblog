# Haskeline Package

 

[Haskeline](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/haskeline) provides a user interface for line input in command-line programs. This library is similar in purpose to readline, but since it is written in Haskell it is (hopefully) more easily used in other Haskell programs.

# Command Suite Parse

 

[console-program](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/console-program) provides an infrastructure to build command line programs. It provides the following features:

 

* Declare any number of "commands" (modes of operation) of the program;

 

* Declare options of these commands;

 

* Collect options from a configuration file and the command line, and execute the proper command;
