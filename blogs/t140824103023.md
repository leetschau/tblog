# Install New Locale on Linux Mint
Tags: locale; mint

------

After installing a new Linux (Mint 17, xfce),
I need to install Chinese input method, so I have to install Chinese locale at first.

1. List all installed locales: `locale -a`;

1. View all supported locales on your system: `less /usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED`,
   and "zh_CN.UTF-8 UTF-8" is what I want to install;

1. Add this locale into locale list file:
   `echo "zh_CN.UTF-8 UTF-8" >> /var/lib/locales/supported.d/local`;

1. Regenerate locale list: `sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales`;
