# Installation

Following [haskell-mode](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-mode).

1. Use MELPA repository: add the following into ~/.emacs

        (require 'package) 
        (add-to-list 'package-archives 
           '("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/") t) 
        (package-initialize)

1. M-x package-refresh-contents

1. M-x package-install [RET] haskell-mode

# Usage

1. Open a haskell file in emacs;

1. Use "C-c C-z" to open ghci (but there isn't a jump-back shortcut, you can use C-x o);

1. Use "C-c C-l" to load file (same as ":l <file_name>");

However, there isn't tab-completion in the ghci invoked by "C-c C-z",
so you can start a console to run ghci;
