# JSDoc Notes
Tags: javascript; javadoc; comment

------

JSDoc is a documentation generator similar to JavaDoc or PHPDoc.

# JSDoc

Install [JSDoc](https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc) with `npm install -g jsdoc`.
Generate docs with `jsdoc **/*.js`.

# YUIDoc

[YUIDoc](http://yui.github.io/yuidoc/) is suitable for generate documentation for [YUI](http://yuilibrary.com/),
a JavaScript library, and no longer actively maintained.

It can only list modules and classes on the homepage,
which is not very suitable for general purpose jsdoc.

Install it with `npm install -g yuidocjs`.
Run it with `yuidoc .`.
It creates a folder named "out" by default in the current directory.
Open the index.html in "out" folder to see the doc.

# Editor

vim with [scrooloose/nerdcommenter](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdcommenter).
Use `<leader>cs` to add block comment.
But note that the block generated by this plugin is started by `/*`, which is invalid for jsdoc and yuidoc.
You have to add an asterisk behind it as `/**`.
