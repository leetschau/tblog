# Running Meteor and Node App on Ubuntu 14.04 VPS
Tags: vps; ubuntu; meteor; node

------

# Setup Environment with MUP

On your laptop, install mup with `npm install -g mup`.
In a new directory, create a mup project with `mup init`.
Set "setupMongo", "setupNode" and "setupPhantom" to "true" in mup.json,
and run `mup setup`.

# Run Apps

To install the **first** Meteor app, `mup deploy`.

To install the second (there has been a Meteor app is running) or more,
set "setupMongo", "setupNode" and "setupPhantom" to "false" in mup.json,
change "appname", "app" and values in "env" accordingly.
Finally run `mup deploy`.

For Node app, first get the source code with git,
then run it with forever, which is installed by mup:

    aptitude install git
    git clone ... projHome
    cd projHome
    npm install
    # confirm port number in config.js
    forever start app.js  # when the main script is "app.js"

Get the app status with `forever list`.
If the app can't start, print logs with `forever logs 1`
(if the target app's index in `forever list` is 1).

# Setup Routes

Note: MUP requires Node v0.10.36 or later.
So do NOT install node with `aptitude install nodejs`.
