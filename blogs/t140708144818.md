# Build macro for batch manipulate Excel Files

Now I have to add a security mark for many many excel files. I use the following the following VBA codes to achieve this.

1. Run Excel 2010, save the new blank file as "Excel Macro-Enabled Workbook", named "AddMark.xlsm" (via [File -> Save as]);

1. Open "Developer" ribbon: [File -> Options -> Customize ribbon], check "Developer" in right panel, press "OK" to close the dialog, you can see "Developer" ribbon now;

1. In "developer" ribbon, click "Visual Basic" to open the VBA IDE (or use shortcut "Alt-F11");

1. In visual basic IDE, add "Microsoft Scripting Run-time" and "Microsoft Scriptlet Library" in [Tools -> References] of main menu;

1. Add the following codes to [VBAProject -> Microsoft Excel Objects -> This Workbook]:

    Option Explicit
    Sub InsertMark2Excels()
        Dim fso As New FileSystemObject
        Dim folder As Object
        Set folder = fso.GetFolder(ActiveWorkbook.Path)
        LoopFolder folder
        Call WriteLog("Creation Date: " & Now)
        Call WriteLog("Log over.")
    End Sub
    Sub LoopFolder(FF As Scripting.folder)
        Dim F As Scripting.File
        Dim SubF As Scripting.folder
        Dim fso As New FileSystemObject
        For Each F In FF.Files
            Dim fext As String
            fext = fso.GetExtensionName(F)
            If fext = "xls" Or fext = "xlsx" Then
                InsertMark F.Path
            End If
        Next F
        For Each SubF In FF.SubFolders
            LoopFolder SubF
        Next SubF
    End Sub
    Sub InsertMark(target As String)
        Workbooks.Open target
        ActiveWorkbook.Sheets(1).Activate
        ActiveWorkbook.Sheets(1).Rows("1:1").Select
        Selection.Insert Shift:=xlDown, CopyOrigin:=xlFormatFromLeftOrAbove
        Range("A1").Select
        ActiveCell.FormulaR1C1 = "保密"
        ActiveWorkbook.Save
        ActiveWorkbook.Close
        Call WriteLog("Insert mark to " & target)
    End Sub
    Sub WriteLog(log As String)
        Open ActiveWorkbook.Path & "\insertmark.log" For Append As #1
        Print #1, log
        Close #1
    End Sub

1. Add shortcut for macro "InsertMark2Excels": in ribbon Developer -> Macro, then click "Options", assign Ctrl-d to this macro;

Now you can copy AddMark.xlsm to another host, open this file, press Ctrl-d to run the macro.

# Open Office Macro in LibreOffice

1. Open xlsm file with LibreOffice Calc, or simply `thunar filename.xlsm`;

1. Tools -> Macros -> Organize Macros -> LibreOffice Basic, select [AddMark.xlsm -> VBA Project -> Document Objects -> ThisWorkbook] in "Macro from", then select a macro in "Existing macros", then click "Edit" button.
