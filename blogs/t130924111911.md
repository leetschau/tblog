# Batch rename in zsh
Tags: zsh;rename

------

There are many mp3 files with initial "Various - ...", like:

    Various - Beethoven:Symphony No.5-Allegro Con Brio.mp3

Now I want to remove the "Various - " in the file name, to "Beethoven:Symphony No.5-Allegro Con Brio.mp3".

In zsh we have a tool called zmv can do this job. Firstly we have to use `autoload zmv` to activate it. Then use "-n" option to print the result without actually performing the rename operation. When it is ok, remove the -n option to rename all the files:

    zmv -n '(*).mp3' '${1//Various\ -\ /}.mp3'
    zmv '(*).mp3' '${1//Various\ -\ /}.mp3'
