# Server (IP: 10.21.3.31)

1. Install: sudo apt-get install tightvncserver

1. Config: vi ~/.vnc/xstartup

Add: "xfwm4 & xfdesktop & xfce4-panel & xfce4-session" after " /etc/X11/Xsession"

1. Set login passwd: vncpasswd

1. Start service: vncserver :1 -geometry 800x600

1. Stop service: vncserver -kill :1

# Client

1. Install: sudo apt-get install vncviewer

1. Connect: vncviewer 10.21.3.31:1

Problem: This is a new desttop, how to connect to the "old" desktop?

Note: 

There are some other vnc server, I tried vino and x11vnc both not work. Generally, GUI server function of Linux is much weak than that of Windows. You can use "Remmina" and rdp protocol to connect to a Windows server conveniently. So try to avoid use GUI between remote hosts, using ssh terminal instead.
