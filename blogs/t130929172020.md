# Question and Python Solution

The follow is a question I posted on stackoverflow.com and
the Python imperative style solution:

I wrote a simple procedure to calculate the average of the test coverage of some
specific packages in a Java project.
The raw data in a huge html file is like this: 

    <body> 
    package pkg1 <line_coverage>11/111,<branch_coverage>44/444<end> 
    package pkg2 <line_coverage>22/222,<branch_coverage>55/555<end> 
    package pkg3 <line_coverage>33/333,<branch_coverage>66/666<end> 
    ... 
    </body> 

Given the specified packages "pkg1" and "pkg3", for example,
the average line coverage is: 

    (11+33)/(111+333) 

and average branch coverage is: 

    (44+66)/(444+666) 

I wrote the follow procedure to get the result and it works well.
But how to implement this calculation in a functional style?
Something like "(x,y) for x in ... for b in ... if...".
I know a little Erlang, Haskell and Clojure,
So solutions in these languages are also appreciated. Thanks a lot! 

    from __future__ import division 
    import re 
    datafile = ('abc', 'd>11/23d>34/89d', 'e>25/65e>13/25e', 'f>36/92f>19/76') 
    core_pkgs = ('d', 'f') 
    covered_lines, total_lines, covered_branches, total_branches = 0, 0, 0, 0 
    for line in datafile: 
        for pkg in core_pkgs: 
            ptn = re.compile('.*'+pkg+'.*'+'>(\d+)/(\d+).*>(\d+)/(\d+).*') 
            match = ptn.match(line) 
            if match is not None: 
                cvln, tlln, cvbh, tlbh = match.groups() 
                covered_lines += int(cvln) 
                total_lines += int(tlln) 
                covered_branches += int(cvbh) 
                total_branches += int(tlbh) 
    print 'Line coverage:', '{:.2%}'.format(covered_lines / total_lines) 
    print 'Branch coverage:', '{:.2%}'.format(covered_branches/total_branches) 
 

# Functional Style Solution in Clojure

```
(defn extract-data 
 "extract 4 integer from a string line according to a package name" 
 [pkg line] 
 (map read-string 
  (rest (first 
    (re-seq 
    (re-pattern 
    (str pkg ".*>(\\d+)/(\\d+).*>(\\d+)/(\\d+)")) 
    line))))) 
(defn scan-lines-by-pkg 
 "scan all string lines and extract all data as integer sequences 
 according to package names" 
 [pkgs lines] 
 (filter seq (for [pkg pkgs 
     line lines] 
    (extract-data pkg line)))) 
(defn sum-data 
 "add all data in valid lines together" 
 [pkgs lines] 
 (apply map + (scan-lines-by-pkg pkgs lines))) 
(defn get-percent 
 [covered all] 
 (str (format "%.2f" (float (/ (* covered 100) all))) "%")) 
(defn get-cov 
 [pkgs lines] 
 {:line-cov (apply get-percent (take 2 (sum-data pkgs lines))) 
 :branch-cov (apply get-percent (drop 2 (sum-data pkgs lines)))}) 
(get-cov ["d" "f"] ["abc" "d>11/23d>34/89d" "e>25/65e>13/25e" "f>36/92f>19/76"]) 
```
 
# clojure solutions with load file and command line args

```
core-pkgs=...+...+...
clojure get-cov.clj $core-pkgs
(def s (slurp "frame-summary.html"))
(use 'clojure.string)
(def lines (split s #"\n"))
```
