# Tools

## Disk IO Benchmark

### Writing Speed

    $ dd bs=1M count=512 if=/dev/zero of=test conv=fdatasync

from [Simple Disk Benchmarking in Linux Using 'dd'](http://systembash.com/content/simple-disk-benchmarking-in-linux-using-dd/)

### Reading Speed

    $ hdparm -tT $(df $HOME|awk 'FNR == 2 {print $1}')

where "df $HOME|awk 'FNR == 2 {print $1}'" get the disk name of the $HOME folder. For example, on my laptop it is /dev/sda1, on 49 server it is /dev/mapper/vg_bocoty49-lv_root. In awk command, "FNR == 2" means the second line.
This is the "origin" version:

    $ hdparm -tT /dev/sda

## Network Throughput Benchmark

Run the following command on the "server" host, not the "client" host which is testd.

    $ cat testspeed.sh

    filesize=$3
    dd bs=1M count=$filesize if=/dev/zero of=test
    timeres=$(/usr/bin/time -p scp test $1@$2:/home/$1/ 2>&1 >/dev/null)
    echo timeres: $timeres
    duration=$(echo $timeres|awk 'FNR == 1 {print $2}')
    echo duration: $duration
    speed=$(echo "scale=2; $filesize / $duration" | bc -l)
    echo $speed MB/s

The output format of "time" and "bc" command varies depending on distro of OS, so I only implements above on my OS: Linux Mint 14.
The "-p" options give a better output format of this command.
The output of "scp" is in stdout, while that of "time" in stderr, so I hide stdout and redirect stderr to stdout, so the output can be processed by the following "awk".
"bc -l" do a float division instead of a integer division.
"scale=2" set the division scale (precision) to 2 digits after the period.

Run this scprit with a 64MB test file:

    $ ./speed.sh chad 10.0.2.49 64

Now with a 128MB test file:

    $ ./testspeed.sh 128

Note: iperf is network throughput tool, but it has to be installed. So it's a little complicated.
