# repeatedly function in Clojure

    user=> (doc repeatedly) 
    ------------------------- 
    clojure.core/repeatedly 
    ([f] [n f]) 
     Takes a function of no args, presumably with side effects, and 
     returns an infinite (or length n if supplied) lazy sequence of calls 
     to it 
    nil

    user=> (repeatedly 5 (fn [] 90)) 
    (90 90 90 90 90)

    user=> (type (repeatedly 5 (fn [] 90))) 
    clojure.lang.LazySeq

    user=> (repeatedly 5 (fn [] (do (println "hi") 75))) 
    (hi 
    hi 
    75 hi 
    75 hi 
    75 hi 
    75 75) 
    user=> (repeatedly (fn [] 87)) 
    OutOfMemoryError Java heap space java.util.Arrays.copyOf (:-1)

So you can see repeatedly can take a function with/without side effect.
But how to return a function with infinite length?
