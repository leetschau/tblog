# Compare Files Remotely with Diff

 

For example, compare ~/.vimrc at different hosts:

 

 ssh bvt@10.0.2.74 "cat /home/bvt/.vimrc" | diff -y --suppress-common-lines - .vimrc

 

where -y is abbr. of "--side-by-side".

 

# Compare Files in Two Directories

 

Usually we use the following command to compare source files in two directories:

 

## Find out which files are different

 

 ┌─[lichao@lichao480] - [~/docs/erlang/processquest-1.0.0/apps] 
 └─[$] diff -rq sockserv-1.0.0/src sockserv-1.0.1/src 
 Files sockserv-1.0.0/src/sockserv_serv.erl and sockserv-1.0.1/src/sockserv_serv.erl differ

 

then use vimdiff to show detailed differences between these files.

-r means "recursively", -q means only report different files.

 

## Print out differences of files directly

 

 ┌─[lichao@lichao480] - [~/docs/erlang/processquest-1.0.0/apps] - [1672] 
 └─[$] diff -y --suppress-common-lines sockserv-1.0.0/src sockserv-1.0.1/src 
 diff -y --suppress-common-lines sockserv-1.0.0/src/sockserv_serv.erl sockserv-1.0.1/src/sockserv_serv.erl 
          >  gen_tcp:close(S#state.socket), 
 terminate(normal, #state{socket=S}) ->    | terminate(normal, _State) -> 
  gen_tcp:close(S);       |  ok;
