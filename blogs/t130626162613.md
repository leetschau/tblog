Tested on Live CD mode. See " Note about Live CDs ".

# Mint Cinnamon 15 64bit

Beautiful, use Win key to bring up app panel, search apps in Windows-like style, can not configure custom shortcuts. Maybe you can define it with gconf-editor, but it's complicated;

# Mint Xfce

Concise, easy to define custom shortcuts;

# openSUSE 13.1 GNOME

This version use GNOME 3. The problem is the system tray disappears. So I can't exit H3C client.

Another problem of this version is the network server is not up by default. It's really not convenient.

# Debian Gnome

Good GUI, with Win key enabled and easy app search. No wireless card support.

# Precise Puppy

Simple GUI, can't display Chinese Charactors(no UTF-8 support?), responding very slowing when ssh to remote server, can use wireless network;
