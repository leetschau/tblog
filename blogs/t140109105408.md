# Workflow

The first release(v0.1): see Publish and Install Applications via PyPI for how to commit to PyPI;

After uploading your first release to PyPI, the basic workflow is:

1. Do some work on your package (i.e. fix bugs, add features, etc);
 
1. Make sure the tests pass;
 
1. "Freeze" your code by creating a release branch in git-flow;
 
1. Update the __version__ number in your package's __init__.py file;
 
1. Run "python setup.py sdist upload" to upload the new version of your package to PyPI; 

For usage of git-flow, see note "git-flow Notes".

# virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper

See Note about virturalenvwrapper.

# Publish a Python Application

Add a "command_line.py" in <project-name> module, and "entry_points" in setup.py. See the 4th step "Command Line Scripts" in [How To Package Your Python Code](http://www.scotttorborg.com/python-packaging/index.html) for details.

## Necessary Files

### setup.py

Some necessary parameters:

* entry_points: for defind executables;

* install_requires: for defining dependencies, get this from "pip freeze" command (exculde the application itself);

### MANIFEST.in

  Add "inculde README.md" (and other necessary files for installation) in this file, or README.md will note be packaged into installer, and in installation a "README.md not found" error raises because you read this file in setup.py.
