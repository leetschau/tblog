# Virtual Windows on Xpra
Tags: xpra; VirtualBox; Windows

------

I want run a virtual machine (Windows 7 system, named "Win7Office")  on a remote PC (10.32.1.81).

# Modify VM config

Start VirtualBox GUI (locally via physical monitor and keyboard connected with host 81, or via VNC). Check "Auto-resize Guest Display" in vm's Settings -> View menu. Then start Win7Office, verify if vm run properly. Once OK, close this vm.

# Use VM remotely

On client, run following commands:

    ssh 81
    xpra start :111 --start-child="VBoxManage startvm Win7Office"
    exit
    xpra attach ssh:81:111

Once done, use `xpra detach ssh:81:111` to detach from this VM.
