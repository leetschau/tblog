# Domain knowledge

Feature *comb08* represents *combine fuel efficiency* (in Chapter 2, page 43);
*displ* represents the engine displacement in liters (in page 206);
*atvType* represents alternative or advanced technology vehicle (in chaper 2, page 33).

The same place for explanations of feature barrels08, barrelsA08, charge120, charge240.

# Python Implementation

[pandas.melt](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.melt.html)
convert a dataframe from *wide format* (宽表) to a *long format*.

The converting rule based on distingishing all the columns from *id*, *variable*
(like *dimension* in BI) and *value* (like *measure* in BI).
