# GitBook

Login to [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/), create a book.
Clone to local, modify (all markdown files), push.
That's it!

But now it's unstable. Some notes can't be converted. The build ofen fails.

# Octopress

## Install

Ref: [Octopress Setup](http://octopress.org/docs/setup/).

    sudo apt-get update
    curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
    rvm install 2.2 
    rvm rubygems latest

Then install nvm, here I use node.js v6.9.1.

    cd ~/apps
    git clone git://github.com/imathis/octopress.git octopress
    cd octopress
    gem install bundler
    bundle install
    rake install

Note1: Do NOT use ruby 2.1.1, it can't install bundler, while ruby 2.1.2 is OK.

Note2: Ruby 1.9.3 in pre-installed on Ubuntu 14.04.
An "Permission denied" error occurs when `gem install bundler`.
You have to `rvm install 2.1.2` to build a non-root ruby environment to install bundler.

Note3: If `bundle install` runs slow or stucked
(in common case it takes less than 5s for installing a component),
cancel it with Ctrl-C and rerun this command.

## Usage

### Setup

First create a new repo named "<username>.github.io" on [GitHub](https://github.com/),
"leetschau.github.io" for example.

Then build the blog website framework: `rake setup_github_pages`.
When asked for the repository URL, provide the SSH one for convenient.

### Configuration

Modify `_config.yml` to customize blog's title, subtitle, author and blog descriptions.

Under "3rd Party Settings", set "github_user" as "<username>".

### Post new blog

Run the following command to create a new post, and edit post content:

    rake new_post["Hello World"]
    vi source/_posts/2014-08-18-hello-world.markdown

### Preview blog website

Run the following command to generate new post and preview them:

    rake generate
    rake watch    // optional
    rake preview

If it complains no javascript rumtime found, run `nvm use 0.10`,
where version number "0.10" is determined by `nvm list`.
Now preview with url "http://localhost:4000".

### Deploy to Github

Run generate and deploy tasks:

    rake generate

If it complains no javascript rumtime found, run `nvm use 0.10`.

    rake deploy

You need provide username (without @gmail.com) and password of your github account.

If you use a new octopress, but deploy to an existing github blog,
you'll encounter a push failure when `rake deploy`.

Go to `$OCTOPRESS_HOME/_deploy` and run:

    git pull origin master
    git add -A
    git ci -m "merge conflict manually"

Run `rake deploy` again in $OCTOPRESS_HOME,
your blogs should be synchronized to github.

There are many other [Static site generators](http://www.mzlinux.org/?q=node/415).
Some based on Python such as [Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican)
looks lighter than Octopress.
