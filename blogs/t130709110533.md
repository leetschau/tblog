# Set Classpath for Groovy on Linux
Tags: classpath;Java;groovy

------

The "-cp" option of groovy is the same with Java.

 

Wildcards can be used on JDK6 or later. For example: 

 

 groovy -cp "/home/chad/apps/http-builder-0.6/*:/home/chad/apps/http-builder-0.6/dependencies/*" httpex.groovy

 

Note1: "**" is not supported, which means above command can not written as:

 

 groovy -cp "/home/chad/apps/http-builder-0.6/**" httpex.groovy

 

Note2: "*.jar" is not supported, which means "/home/chad/apps/http-builder-0.6/*.jar" is invalid;

 

Note3: the double quotes of classpath is necessary;

 

Note4: "/home/chad" in classpath can not be replaced by "~";
