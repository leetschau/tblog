# Linux Mint 64bit

Today I tried Dart official tutorial [Avast, Ye Pirates: Write a Web App](https://www.dartlang.org/codelabs/darrrt/). When I run dartium in "Step 1: Run the skeleton app", I met the following errors:

> Could not launch browser - process terminated while trying to connect. Try closing and running Dartium instances.:
> Dartium stdout: /home/xxx/Apps/dart/chromium/chrome:error while loading share libraries: libudev.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

The official solution [PreparingYourMachine](https://code.google.com/p/dart/wiki/PreparingYourMachine) on dart wiki is somewhat complicated.
For I've installed Chrome, there is a simple way to resolve this problem:

    sudo ln -s /opt/google/chrome/libudev.so.0 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libudev.so.0

Verified on Linux Mint 17 x86_64.

Notes:

* I met a "404 not found" error when install libudev-dev with aptitude.

* To install chrome, download google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb from [Chrome official website](https://www.google.com/chrome/).

# ArchLinux

Download Dart complete bundle (darteditor-linux-x64.zip) on[Dart website](https://www.dartlang.org/).
Extract it, and start dart editor with ./DartEditor.
However, when running a dart project with "Run in dartium" context menu, an "libgconf.so.4 no exist" error raises.
So we have to install dart sdk to provide this library file: `sudo pacman -S dart`.

You can also install dart-editor and dartium from AUR:

    yaourt -S dart-editor dartium-bin

But it's very slow.
