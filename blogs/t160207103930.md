# Packages

Haskell packages can be installed in user level (global, like `npm install -g`)
or project level (local, like `npm install`).

The default behavior of cabal is user level:

    cabal install <package-name>

To install package in project level, you need create a sandbox beforehand:

    cabal sandbox init     # run in project root folder
    cabal install <package-name>

The global packages are stored in $HOME/.cabal/packages folder,
while local packages are stored in $PROJ_ROOT/.cabal-sandbox/lib folder.
