`gem` (as a command) is a tool to download and install gems from
[RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/).
It's Python counterpart should be `pip` in global environment.
It installs some global gems (files), such as rake, bundler, etc.
Use `gem list` to list these system-level gems.
Use `gem env` to print environment setup,
notice *INSTALLATION PATH* and *GEM PATHS* in the output.
Or `gem env gemdir` for gem path.

"gem" (as a file on disk), such as "bundler-1.6.1.gem" is a package which has
the same standard structure. It's text (not binary) but not readable,
like minified js file for JavaScript, jquery.min.js for example.

[bundler](http://bundler.io/) is used to manage project-level gems,
it read the Gemfile of a project and install these gems in project environment.
It works based on a spec file named "Gemfile" at project's root directory.
It's "ivy.xml" of Ivy configurations for Java.

[rake](https://rubygems.org/gems/rake) is a build tool of Ruby.
You can define many tasks and their dependencies in the file "Rakefile"
in the project's root directory. And run these tasks with `rake <task-name>`.
It's Ant for Java, or make for Linux.

Functions of Maven or Gradle for Java covers bundler and rake.
